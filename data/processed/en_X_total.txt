dumb	muslims	complain	about	freedom	of	speech	and	support	blasphemy	laws	at	the	same	time	what	a	disgusting	inhuman	religion
islam	can	not	forbid	anything	it	is	a	sick	cult	with	no	power	under	the	law
one	must	imagine	god	being	insulted	by	having	such	a	hateful	war	mongering	decisive	bigoted	sexist	religion	calling	him
it	is	the	muslims	that	do	n't	follow	the	quran	and	hadiths	that	are	peaceful	those	who	follow	it	are	always	violent
why	do	these	so	called	moderate	muslims	never	ask	themselves	why	islam	has	over	100	terrorist	groups	and	no	other	religion	is	remotely	close
stop	threatening	people	to	get	them	to	do	what	you	want	that	's	why	people	hate	religion
rt	muhammad	was	the	inventor	of	thighing	he	started	molesting	aisha	when	she	was	6	years	old	cc
how	many	times	do	i	have	to	tell	you	that	most	muslims	are	extremists
do	you	think	that	the	brick	heads	at	salon	know	that	the	prophet	mohammed	beheaded	people	in	mass
then	export	all	the	non	citizen	imams	put	cameras	in	the	remaining	mosques
why	should	you	be	annoyed	at	being	denied	rights	that	you	do	n't	give	to	others	you	are	a	hypocrite
so	when	the	subject	of	islam	's	relationship	with	terrorism	comes	up	they	react	like	the	empty	morons	they	are
until	we	get	beyond	making	excuses	for	just	a	few	bad	muslims	and	recognize	islam	as	a	religion	of	terror	paris	will	keep	happening
i	choose	to	define	it	by	the	quran	and	it	's	followers	and	most	are	extremists
rt	of	course	because	radical	islam	by	definition	under	sharia	means	going	back	in	time	its	uncivilized

no	they	showed	you	the	good	face	of	people	there	is	no	good	face	of	islam

the	idea	about	all	of	these	moderate	muslims	is	oversold	most	are	extremists
now	if	we	can	only	get	the	world	to	recognize	that	islam	declared	war	on	humanity	1400	ago	and	outlaw	it
now	if	hollande	and	other	leaders	will	only	understand	that	the	islam	of	the	quran	is	radical	islam	outlaw	islam
a	piece	at	a	time	start	by	outlawing	new	mosques	and	stoping	muslim	immigration
i	do	n't	really	care	what	some	muslims	practice	i	care	that	islam	encourages	murder	hatred	sexism
we	would	be	much	better	off	figuring	out	what	to	do	about	islamofascim	than	ranting	about	freedom	of	speech	or	who	went	to	paris

like	all	such	writers	they	blab	on	endlessly	as	experts	without	ever	having	read	the	quran	or	hadiths
i	read	the	entire	quran	islam	is	what	is	wrong
a	muslim	's	religious	freedom	involves	denying	others	their	freedom	so	islam	must	be	outlawed
the	prophet	mohammed	also	had	people	murdered	for	criticizing	him	so	the	paris	murders	were	very	much	a	part	of	the	real
if	you	search	objectively	you	will	find	that	the	pedophile	prophet	mohammed	declared	war	on	all	humanity	1400	years	ago
rt	all	religions	are	not	the	same	islam	is	more	violent	than	other	religions
what	does	isis	do	that	the	prophet	mohammed	did	not	also	do
i	read	the	quran	it	is	a	hate	mongering	piece	of	filth
rt	twisted	logic	in	the	world	of	islam
looks	to	me	like	baghdadi	is	a	carbon	copy	of	mohammed	without	the	prophecies
obviously	the	driving	meme	of	islam	is	world	domination	if	it	be	by	force	intimidation	or	persuasion
you	choose	your	religion	and	islam	is	clearly	barbaric	and	inhuman	it	has	zero	to	do	with	god
as	long	as	we	make	feel	good	lectures	and	demonstrations	about	freedom	of	speech	we	are	avoiding	the	real	problem	the	violence	of	islam

it	's	not	about	satire	or	free	speech	pretending	it	is	will	solve	nothing	the	problem	is	that	the	quran	is	full	of	incitement	for	murder

the	stupidity	of	jihadis	who	think	that	you	only	need	guns	to	run	a	civil	society

the	difference	between	the	daesh	and	the	fsa	is	not	that	big	the	fsa	are	also	islamolunatics

choudary	tells	the	truth	about	islam	islam	has	no	spirituality	it	is	only	about	forcing	the	world	to	obey
no	the	lies	that	i	tell	come	directly	from	the	quran	and	hadiths	like	declaration	of	war	on	humanity
rt	religion	my	ass	death	cult
look	at	the	data	dipwad	2/3	want	sharia	law	which	denies	all	rights	to	women	and	non	muslims
rt	sssshhh	the	silent	muslim	majority	remains	quiet
mullah	oktar	is	a	liar	and	an	islamofanatic	he	hates	the	ypg	for	their	secularism	so	he	makes	up	garbage	about	them
look	at	the	data	dipwad	1/3	think	that	people	who	leave	islam	should	be	killed
mohammed	hid	behind	a	trench	in	medina	when	the	meccan	army	showed	up	so	i	guess	he	was	a	coward	for	that	also
so	you	think	you	can	hate	all	people	of	a	certain	ideaology	but	not	if	it	's	islam
islamic	no	go	zones	are	common	knowledge	except	to	idiots	like	you
rt	islamic	state	members	say	they	're	following	islam	while	non	muslims	who	do	n't	even	read	up	on	religion	insist	they	're	not
islam	declared	war	on	all	humanity	1400	years	ago	it	's	time	we	recognize	that	and	respond
the	problem	was	not	the	communists	atheism	but	rather	their	totalitarianism	just	like	islam
so	isis	beheads	because	their	prophet	beheaded	isis	rapes	slaves	because	their	prophet	raped	them
the	cancer	of	islam	pushes	even	babies	to	begin	thinking	about	murdering	their	fellow	human	beings
this	guy	spouted	one	lie	after	another	and	there	is	no	response	in	this	video	just	typical	lying	muslim	propaganda
and	your	attitude	is	to	let	creeping	sharia	and	sexism	into	muslim	areas	of	the	west
the	idea	that	no	go	zones	are	a	right	wing	boogie	man	is	stupid	no	go	zones	are	real
the	shia	and	sunni	are	back	to	killing	each	other	in	yemen	as	they	have	done	everywhere	for	1400	years	the	gift	of
no	they	do	n't	they	share	a	commitment	to	the	barbarity	of	their	religion
professor	attacked	on	campus	for	telling	truth	about	islam	the	religion	that	can	not	survive	without	killing	speech
your	mantra	about	a	few	is	stupid	this	proves	it
eh	they	all	ostensible	follow	the	ideology	of	islam	radicals	follow	closely	others	less	so
islam	has	contributed	nothing	to	humanity	but	hatred	death	and	destruction	for	a	thousand	years
so	are	you	saying	that	the	quran	is	wrong	with	this	piece	of	bigotry
yeap	islam	is	for	ignorant	butts
love	it	when	these	idiot	national	leaders	claim	that	terrorism	has	nothing	to	do	with	islam	and	not	one	has	read	the	quran
salahuddin	was	a	general	who	fought	for	islamic	slavery	what	does	that	have	to	do	with	kurds	fighting	for	freedom	today
what	the	americans	did	in	iraq	was	allow	the	iraqis	to	elect	their	leadership	sunnis	and	shia	killing	each	other	is	islam
t	again	the	woman	must	be	obedient	to	the	man	even	if	he	is	a	fool	and	she	is	brilliant	you	are	proving	my	point	again
yeah	unlike	the	muslims	who	are	executing	gays	by	throwing	them	off	buildings
the	prophet	mohammed	was	a	caravan	robber	who	declared	war	on	all	humanity	hope	the	jews	recover	their	stolen	land
more	left	wing	scum	caving	in	to	the	violence	of	islam
next	step	learning	to	ride	a	bicycle	and	then	learning	to	ride	a	camel
no	go	zones	are	exactly	acting	to	impose	such	microbrain
there	should	be	no	freedom	to	impose	your	religion	on	others	and	that	is	what	islam	is	about
one	of	the	pedophile	prophets	big	battles	was	the	battle	of	the	trench	in	medina	isis	are	trying	to	imitate	that	trick	with	a	mosul	trench
t	women	should	have	the	same	sexual	rights	as	me	but	islam	says	they	clearly	do	n't
and	those	few	discoveries	were	made	despite	islam	not	because	of	it	islam	has	contributed	nothing	to	mankind	in	1000	years
and	historians	have	actually	made	countless	efforts	to	independently	collaborate	anything	in	islam	it	's	totally	fabricated
rt	theresa	may	today	pleaded	with	not	to	leave	jews	build	wealth	muslims	take	welfare	simple	economics
so	when	are	you	going	to	admit	that	the	quran	is	wrong	i	'm	waiting
isis	mortared	kobane	killing	women	and	children	so	you	just	called	isis	cowards	lol	idiot
rt	muslim	bigot	wanted	by	interpol	and	protected	by	u.s.	ally	wants	un	to	criminalize	criticism	of	islam	internationally	htt
nazis	were	not	christians	mohammed	led	17	major	military	expeditions	jesus	led	zero
mullah	oktar	is	an	anti	science	kurd	hating	islamolunatic
rt	a	simple	question	ask	complaining	muslims	why	etc	can	integrate	amp	live	h
and	by	doing	so	she	helped	subject	the	world	to	1400	years	of	terrorism
islam	is	terror	to	fight	terror	you	have	to	fight	islam	your	prophet	and	your	god	are	both	sick	terrorists
crucifixion	stoning	beheading	shooting	throwing	off	buildings	isis	is	an	orgy	if	sadistic	gruesome	methods	of	murder
the	violence	is	always	initiated	by	the	muslims	mohammed	started	it	proof
so	they	have	to	imprison	the	people	of	mosul	and	not	allow	them	to	leave	islam	is	a	religion	of	slaves	and	slavery
hamaz	never	stopped	it	's	war	on	israel	islam	never	stopped	it	's	war	on	humanity
the	quran	writer	imagined	god	as	egotistical	and	as	wanting	to	be	worshiped	and	bowed	to	because	he	was	unsophisticated
there	is	nothing	that	isis	does	that	the	prophet	mohammed	did	n't	also	do
the	jews	lived	on	40	of	arabian	peninsula	before	mohammed	began	genocide
like	i	said	that	is	a	stupid	comment	that	seeks	to	hide	the	vileness	of	islam
everyone	else	does	not	follow	a	pedophile	prophet	who	owned	27	slaves	robbed	caravans	and	raped	women	only	muslims
your	prophet	used	catapults	to	attack	cities	murdering	women	and	children	so	what	are	you	crying	about
mohammed	was	murdering	jews	before	zionism	existed
they	ca	n't	read	write	do	math	or	produce	anything	but	they	can	kill	people	so	they	are	good	muslims
the	little	girls	draw	the	highest	price	because	of	your	pedophile	prophet
honest	and	fair	is	that	islam	is	a	religion	of	hate	murder	bigotry	and	sexism
no	he	's	not	he	's	an	idiot	he	retweets	things	like	nigger	hunting	licenses	that	never	existed	he	's	a	fraud
polls	show	that	the	majority	of	muslims	are	very	primitive	in	their	believes
the	hatred	against	jews	and	christians	and	others	was	begun	by	mohammed
no	the	hatred	was	all	started	by	mohammed
so	the	only	way	the	problems	of	islam	can	be	fixed	is	to	outlaw	islam
proof	mohammed	was	a	pedophile
the	prophet	mohammed	was	a	big	murderer	he	once	beheaded	600	jews	in	one	day	isis	does	what	he	did
islam	declared	war	on	all	mankind	1400	years	ago	now	muslims	cry	like	babies	when	others	respond	in	kind
the	quran	itself	is	the	source	of	the	hatred	murder	imperialism	sexism
there	is	nothing	that	isis	does	that	prophet	mohammed	did	not	also	do
isis	makes	women	cover	and	locks	them	up	because	that	is	what	mohammed	did
a	typical	muslim	response	is	to	excuse	muslim	barbarity	by	pointing	elsewhere
another	barbaric	aspect	of	islam	is	to	murder	people	for	the	way	they	were	born
for	example	muslims	claim	algebra	but	the	greeks	and	indians	were	making	good	progress	on	algebra	before	mohammed	was	born
islam	on	the	other	hand	fights	to	take	away	people	's	freedom	and	force	them	to	obey	an	imaginary	terrorist	god
rt	isis	intend	turn	war	of	islamism	into	ethnic	war	of	pan	arabism&amp;kurd	in	mosul	as	evidence	show	they	are	conducting	pan	ara
the	term	islamophobe	makes	as	much	sense	as	naziophobe
the	difference	between	judism	and	islam	is	no	foundation	in	jihad	in	judaism
earthly	tyrants	want	to	be	feared	because	for	them	fear	is	control	and	obedience	the	writer	of	the	quran	was	unsophisticated
that	old	line	of	bs	there	are	over	100	islamic	terrorist	orgs	no	other	religion	is	close
buddhist	teaching	does	not	contain	violence	hatred	or	jihad	islam	does
raping	children	is	what	mohammed	did
you	must	have	found	it	in	your	imagination	because	it	does	n't	exist	in	islam
isis	wants	to	control	the	world	because	mohammed	wanted	to	control	it
islamic	documentation	is	based	on	belief	historical	documentation	is	based	of	factual	research
yahya	flips	out	about	pkk	being	communists	but	that	is	clearly	no	longer	true	just	propaganda
tell	me	something	that	isis	does	that	mohammed	did	not	do
i	know	that	the	scum	mohammed	engraved	hatred	for	jews	into	islam
our	poor	live	far	better	than	the	middle	class	of	most	muslim	countries
ca	n't	expect	honesty	from	people	who	follow	a	caravan	robber
the	quran	was	produced	by	a	pedophile	slave	trader	caravan	robber	murderer
that	is	why	we	are	going	secular	microbrain	and	islam	is	as	disgusting	as	ever
well	since	islam	is	full	of	hate	and	divisiveness	it	does	bring	thugs	who	hate	to	islam
sharia	taking	injustice	to	new	heights
you	will	see	that	loss	of	men	and	weapons	accelerate	land	loss	in	the	next	few	months	the	kurds	are	on	the	mosul	doorstep
mohammed	was	illiterate	and	superstitious	and	islam	's	backwardness	is	catching	up	to	it	's	jihadis
muslim	declared	war	on	humanity	and	their	have	been	murdering	men	women	and	children	for	1400	years
jesus	did	n't	murder	rape	rob	go	to	war	or	own	slaves	like	mohammed
but	at	least	half	of	muslims	are	extremists	again
if	you	do	n't	want	to	read	a	pedo	you	have	to	stop	reading	the	quran
are	not	destructive	and	inhuman	by	design	like	islam
the	muslims	attacked	europe	400	years	before	crusades	microbrain
and	we	fought	the	germans	for	their	actions	the	first	crusades	were	muslims	attacking	christiandom
you	ca	n't	even	imagine	how	i	think	because	i	can	not	imagine	how	anyone	would	take	such	a	vile	religion	as	islam
but	this	is	a	good	lesson	that	you	ca	n't	win	in	the	21st	century	with	ignorant	madrassa	rats
sharia	put	the	muslim	world	1000	years	behind	the	rest	of	civilization	and	tortured	minorities
the	people	studying	islam	all	have	the	iq	of	a	camel	a	ten	year	old	could	figure	out	that	this	religion	is	evil	by	design
earthly	tyrants	are	also	egotistical	and	want	everyone	to	admire	them	and	bow	down	to	them	so	the	quran	writer	imagined	god
is	designed	to	be	a	crushing	of	the	human	spirit	with	laws	that	only	provide	one	outlet	the	brutalizing	of	non	muslims
my	point	is	that	there	is	nothing	that	isis	does	that	mohammed	did	not	also	do	both	are	sick	and	disgusting	criminals
you	are	the	one	sitting	in	a	black	tent	holding	an	ak	so	do	n't	talk	to	me	about	hate
rt	i	think	the	word	you	're	searching	for	is
nope	with	man	makes	all	the	laws	by	vote	with	allah	makes	all	the	laws	by	the	sword	the	two	can	not	coexist
nothing	is	more	barbaric	that	the	muslims
could	that	be	because	islam	declared	war	on	humanity	1400	years	ago
you	do	understand	that	mohammed	was	a	sexist
you	are	pandering	to	a	religion	that	declared	war	on	all	humanity	1400	years	ago
what	is	there	to	teach	we	both	know	that	the	quran	is	a	cult	manual	of	hatred	imperialism	murder	sexism	and	bigotry
you	like	words	they	all	say	islam	is	vile
the	stupidist	arguments	are	the	ones	rationalizing	the	barbarity	of	islam
i	've	spent	more	time	studying	and	thinking	about	religion	than	you	've	been	alive	i	understand	islam	perfectly
you	must	be	really	young	and	ignorant	if	you	think	a	few	bombing	runs	are	going	to	cause	anyone	to	miss	a	meal	lol
not	to	mention	crushing	poverty	endless	violence	and	legal	forced	marriage	of	8	year	old	girls
daesh	price	list	for	yezidi	and	christian	sex	slaves
in	islam	all	the	facts	are	also	foul
isis	has	slavery	because	the	prophet	mohammed	was	a	slave	owner	and	trader
he	did	n't	discuss	their	wealth	he	discussed	islam	's	barbarity
the	problem	with	islam	is	that	it	can	not	be	fixed	and	still	be	islam
no	muslims	follow	a	religion	based	on	terrorism	not	jews
and	muslims	never	progress	they	are	still	barbaric
if	there	was	a	satan	he	would	have	invented	islam
the	battles	were	won	because	mohammed	gave	his	thugs	80	of	what	they	stole
as	tiny	as	israel	is	the	muslims	want	it	exterminated
judaism	does	n't	want	to	take	over	the	world	like	islam
god	has	zero	need	of	our	worship	or	admiration	or	obedience	it	does	nothing	for	god
isis	beheads	people	because	mohammed	beheaded	600	jews	in	one	day
isis	practices	genocide	because	the	prophet	mohammed	practiced	it
the	logic	of	a	retarded	madrassa	rat
you	are	right	the	violent	murdering	muslims	are	the	only	ones	who	understand	the	meaning	of	their	religion
there	is	actual	spirituality	in	buddhism	and	tao	there	is	zero	spirituality	in	islam
if	you	had	a	brain	it	would	be	revolted	by	islam
and	the	quran	sanctions	raping	slave	girls
the	jews	of	europe	should	just	come	to	the	us	then	the	europeans	can	allow	islam	to	take	them	backwards
majority	of	muslims	are	sexist	and	bigots
no	muslim	land	has	ever	lived	under	anything	but	tyrants	dummy
we	do	n't	make	prophets	out	of	pedophile	priests	we	get	rid	of	them
soon	they	will	have	to	ask	their	uneducated	moronic	madrassa	rats	to	do	surgery	a	butcher	knife	and	a	prayer
buildings	are	not	as	valuable	as	the	men	you	lost	even	if	they	were	rats
looks	like	the	daeshbags	are	now	completely	broken	and	fleeing	the	kobane	area
nothing	justifies	the	existence	of	any	muslim	country	all	muslim	land	is	stolen	land
that	whole	lions	of	islam	thing	is	like	some	kind	of	red	neck	comedy
maybe	you	should	encourage	more	jewish	girls	to	marry	black	men	to	show	how	you	are	open	minded
later	he	attacked	the	jews	of	khybar	killed	many	stole	their	property
then	he	launched	a	completely	unprovoked	attack	on	the	jews	of	khybar	murdered	many	and	stole	their	land
when	muslims	try	to	defend	their	prophet	against	pedophelia	they	never	tell	you	about	the	proof	that	he	was	a	pedo
yes	but	it	smells	great	now	that	the	daesh	rats	have	run
hey	idiot	you	ca	n't	use	the	problems	of	judaism	to	justify	the	barbarity	of	the	quran
then	he	attacked	and	defeated	the	third	medina	tribe	beheaded	all	the	men	and	enslaved	women	and	children
this	is	political	opinion	the	truth	is	that	islam	is	itself	radical	and	we	must	outlaw	it
as	a	result	of	muslim	hatred	there	are	no	jews	or	christians	left	in	saudi
no	that	is	the	excuse	mohammed	used	to	rob	and	murder	he	states	his	genocidal	intention	here
countryside	will	be	easy	to	take	mosul	and	raqqa	will	be	difficult	because	the	daesh	will	hid	behind	civilians
as	you	can	see	for	yourself	pedophelia	is	illegal	in	israel	but	is	legal	in	muslim	countries	outlaw	islam
the	muslims	are	out	of	control	and	determined	to	steal	the	last	tiny	piece	of	land	left	to	the	jews
and	without	western	invention	the	muslim	oil	resources	would	be	nothing	but	a	filthy	useless	liquid
true	stoning	and	beheading	were	much	more	to	mohammed	's	taste
more	like	three	thousand	and	most	of	it	was	done	by	the	kurdish	girls
not	a	single	one	was	left	in	many	gulf	states	and	the	process	of	their	extermination	continues
again	proving	how	muslims	are	liars	the	muslim	students	of	usc	have	a	hadith	database
the	treatment	of	christians	was	nearly	as	bad	and	people	not	of	the	book	were	murdered	outright
yes	we	have	heard	it	a	million	times	islam	is	not	about	islam
a	worshipper	of	the	pedophile	prophet	has	no	room	to	call	anyone	a	biggot	since	islam	is	a	religion	of	hate	and	bigotry
but	muslims	are	dying	to	live	under	sharia	and	to	bring	back	all	the	vileness	and	barbarity	of	their	prophet
obama	refuses	to	recognize	that	there	is	no	difference	between	the	behavior	of	the	prophet	mohammed	and	isis
so	do	n't	feed	me	your	little	piece	of	taqiyya	bs
like	every	muslim	country	they	find	money	for	weapons	but	they	do	n't	have	the	money	for	schools
debunked	what	ignorant	one	you	are	debunked	by	this	8	hadith	say	she	was	six
rt	obama	's	peaceful	islam	islam	that	no	one	is	allowed	to	challenge	even	if	it	means	muslims	threatening	your	life	ht
rt	why	our	president	chose	to	insult	christianity	and	excuse	militant	islam	at	the	national	prayer	breakfast
obviously	you	know	nothing	about	your	religion	permission	to	rape	slave	girls	is	in	both	quran	and	hadiths
funny	how	defenders	of	islam	like	to	bring	up	the	crusades	but	the	muslim	crusaders	were	attacking	christianity	first
and	traitors	are	individuals	not	tribes	and	their	women	and	children	you	make	up	lying	excuses	for	barbarity	like	a	muslim
do	you	approve	of	your	prophet	raping	children
and	i	'm	not	sure	how	you	can	yammer	about	homelessness	when	muslims	are	still	murdering	people	for	apostacy	and	blasphemy
i	do	n't	give	a	shit	about	what	the	talmud	says	because	jews	all	live	under	secular	laws	not	under	talmud
rt	women	from	pakistan	's	christian	and	hindu	minorities	are	particularly	vulnerable	to	forced	marriage	to	muslim	men
mo	expelled	two	jewish	tribes	from	medina	and	stole	their	property	the	third	tribe	he	beheaded	all	the	men	enslaved	the	rest
your	prophet	was	a	low	life	murdering	raping	robbing	bigoted	sexist	pedophile
compared	to	the	sewer	and	violence	and	poverty	of	muslim	pakistan	americans	live	in	opulence
colonizing	and	raping	is	how	the	muslim	world	got	to	be	the	size	it	is	the	first	crusades	were	muslims	invading	europe
in	other	words	you	were	too	stupid	to	understand	that	your	7th	century	barbarity	would	bring	more	enemies
what	was	mohammed	defending	when	he	attacked	the	jews	of	khybar
dodge	rambles	on	making	assertion	after	assertion	with	zero	evidence	and	no	references	in	quran	or	hadith	it	's	garbage
do	you	approve	of	your	pedophile	prophet	raping	a	9	year	old	girl	like	it	says	in	7	hadith
leave	it	to	some	microbrain	to	get	sanctimonious	by	finding	a	way	to	play	the	race	card

this	guy	is	a	muslim	who	is	lying	mohammed	there	are	7	hadith	that	clearly	and	explicitly	state	that	aisha	was	6	when	married
there	is	nothing	in	the	quran	about	forbidding	child	marriages	and	mohammed	married	ashia	at	the	age	of	6
rt	i	once	again	want	to	express	my	gratitude	towards	my	ancestors	for	not	converting	to	islam	i	would	have	no	place	to	hide	in
again	a	muslim	liar	trying	to	change	the	subject	to	hide	the	proven	fact	that	her	prophet	is	a	pedophile
in	islam	the	only	innocent	souls	are	muslims	anyone	else	is	fair	game	for	any	abuse
furthermore	you	can	not	identify	a	single	verse	of	the	quran	that	limits	the	age	of	marriage	of	a	girl
why	would	anyone	loan	money	to	greece	when	they	can	be	99.9	certain	it	will	never	be	paid	back
rt	ezra	levant	from	canadian	jihadis	to	isis	it	's	all	islam	via

another	muslim	troll	trying	to	hide	the	fact	that	his	prophet	was	a	pedophile	by	changing	subject
a	good	muslim	is	good	despite	his	bad	religion	not	because	of	it
and	you	are	an	obvious	liar	because	you	pick	the	smallest	part	of	the	story	to	tell	your	lie	with
because	of	muslim	hatred	there	will	soon	be	no	jews	christians	yezidis	in	me
rt	pakistan	is	a	nation	of	haters	killers	and	savages	see	this	tweet	barbarism	is	in	the	masses	minds
you	sound	like	an	islamolunatic
and	the	muslim	students	hadith	database	shows	ashia	was	6	when	the	pedo	mohammed	married	her
the	story	about	her	age	came	from	both	aisha	and	ursa	it	can	be	found	in	both	bukhari	and	muslim
yes	they	are	jew	hating	barbarians
defensive	sword	roflmao	the	muslims	defended	themselves	all	the	way	to	france	and	india
and	yet	our	number	and	quality	of	schools	are	luxurious	compared	to	pakistan	where	40	do	n't	even	have	working	toilets
yeah	let	the	barbarians	have	it	and	hope	they	come	for	us	last
if	rape	murder	pedophelia	bigotry	war	sexism	and	genocide	are	just	and	peaceful	the	islam	is	just	and	peaceful

rt	our	prophet	our	honor	=	rape	beheadings	and	genocide	our	honor	=	muhammad	does	not	deserve	respect
wrong	microbrain	she	was	6	and	you	like	your	prophet	are	a	liar	here	is	the	proof
this	is	what	christians	and	other	non	muslims	have	had	to	deal	with	for	1400	years	in	the	middle	east
furthermore	all	the	hadiths	about	aisha	's	age	are	classified	as	sahih	meaning	sound
i	hear	all	kinds	of	people	say	that	jews	control	the	agenda	and	the	media
now	since	you	claim	that	islam	limits	age	of	marriage	but	produce	no	verses	to	back	up	your	lies	you	are	blocked
you	muslims	should	kiss	our	ass	for	buying	your	oil	if	we	did	n't	you	'd	be	riding	camels	and	the	population	of	the	me	would	be	1/3
i	know	about	judaism	i	do	n't	recommend	it	but	most	jews	are	secular
different	groups	in	the	me	are	competing	to	see	who	can	be	the	most	islamic	by	being	the	most	barbaric	autocratic	and	inhuman

muslims	always	look	to	excuse	the	barbarity	of	islam	by	changing	the	subject
following	example	of	their	prophet	muslims	are	still	commonly	marrying	children	no	one	else	is
religion	is	a	factor	isis	kills	sunnis	for	disobedience	they	kill	religious	minorities	just	for	being	non	sunni	muslims
and	periodically	the	muslims	went	on	rampages	and	murdered	masses	of	jews	this	happed	all	over	muslim	world
terrorism	has	been	the	core	of	islam	ever	since	the	fraudulent	prophet	mohammed	invented	it
more	of	the	same	kind	of	burning	by	other	muslims
yes	it	's	a	violation	of	islam	because	islam	demands	that	he	be	beheaded	rather	than	burned
and	it	cost	isis	half	their	best	fighters	the	city	can	be	rebuilt	free	of	the	isis	animals

any	achievements	by	jews	in	spain	was	despite	islam	not	because	of	it
the	quran	clearly	and	explicitly	declared	war	on	all	humanity	1400	years	ago	so	humanity	must	declare	war	on	islam

what	does	isis	do	that	your	pedophile	prophet	did	not	do
islam	declared	war	on	all	humanity	1400	years	ago	so	talking	about	murderers	of	muslims	is	total	hypocrisy

i	take	the	whole	sura	microbrain	you	make	such	statement	trying	to	hide	the	barbarity	of	islam
if	that	is	allah	's	wish	then	why	does	n't	the	lazy	asshole	do	it	himself
let	people	look	at	the	polls	that	muslims	answered	and	see	that	they	come	from	hate
mohammed	was	a	murderer	who	had	people	killed	for	disagreeing	with	him
mohammed	was	a	murderer	who	beheaded	600	jews	in	one	day	and	sold	their	women	and	children	into	slavery
poor	daesh	now	they	ca	n't	rape	her	torture	her	or	make	an	execution	video	of	her
it	's	okay	your	pedophile	prophet	used	catapults	against	cities	and	killed	civilians	all	the	time
yeah	it	's	called	caring	about	human	life	idiot	something	a	genocidal	daesh	would'nt	understand
where	the	muslims	followed	the	example	of	mohammed	and	continued	to	murder	them
and	you	lie	again	the	majority	of	muslims	were	forced	into	it
islam	is	simply	an	excuse	to	rape	murder	loot	practice	bigotry	sexism	and	hatred	the	prophet	mohamed	designed	it	to	get	thugs	to	follow
right	every	pres	in	history	has	been	heavily	criticized	but	doing	it	to	obama	has	to	be	racist
when	has	he	ever	done	anything	else
the	jews	initially	all	lived	in	muslim	lands	the	vast	majority	now	live	in	christian	lands
one	christ	terror	group	that	no	longer	exist	is	what	scum	like	you	use	to	rationalize	107	mus	terror	groups
it	's	a	guide	for	nothing	it	's	islam	's	claims	of	the	laws	of	god	and	islam	's	god	is	a	terrorist	islam	's	prophet	too
there	is	no	love	and	respect	in	the	quran	it	is	full	of	hatred	bigotry	sexism	and	incitement	to	murder
take	your	stupid	cult	superstition	and	stick	it	up	your	behind
yes	only	islam	can	generate	that	level	of	barbarity	hatred	and	inhumanity
it	must	be	hard	on	you	terrorists	now	you	ca	n't	rape	that	prisoner	any	more	or	make	a	propaganda	film	of	her	execution
so	while	he	murdered	thousands	of	jews	you	talk	about	visiting	some	sick	neighbor	idiot
mohammed	had	a	child	bride	isis	marries	off	children
the	daesh	are	getting	too	thin	on	manpower	to	hold	all	the	fronts	where	they	need	to	fight	bombing	does	have	an	effect
and	while	we	move	on	islam	goes	backwards	because	their	canon	demand	it
go	read	what	the	pact	says	and	do	n't	waste	my	time
there	was	no	golden	age	jews	were	regularly	slaughter	by	muslims	in	pogroms
another	lie	about	the	few	bad	seed	all	the	polls	show	muslim	extremism
any	idiot	lawyer	could	make	the	case	that	the	quran	should	be	outlawed	on	the	basis	of	being	hate	speech
for	example	the	quran	says	leaving	islam	is	not	accepted	the	hadiths	say	kill	anyone	who	leaves
and	celebratory	shouts	of	fuck	allah	could	be	heard	all	over	the	us	now	daesh	pussies	will	fight	real	soldiers
and	of	course	the	reason	the	majority	now	live	in	christian	lands	is	muslim	abuse
islam	declared	war	on	all	humanity	1400	hundred	years	ago	so	hide	your	head	up	your	butt	if	you	like
this	is	an	isis	humanitarian	concern	it	's	a	terrible	thing	to	do	to	isis	now	they	ca	n't	rape	her	any	more
what	are	you	stupid	there	is	nothing	that	compares	to	the	inhumanity	and	barbarity	of	islam
let	me	guess	you	've	got	no	friends	and	no	career	either	that	or	you	are	a	psychopath
how	idiotic	there	never	were	more	than	5	million	native	americans	and	most	died	from	diseases
mohammed	attacked	the	third	jewish	tribe	in	medina	beheaded	all	of	it	's	men	sold	all	the	rest	to	slavery
now	you	are	babbling	like	every	muslim	conspiracy	idiot	cia	created	isis".utterly	stupid	and	without	evidence	you	are	blocked
mohammed	was	a	rapist	who	raped	young	girls	and	approved	of	the	rape	of	slaves
they	welcomed	islam	with	a	sword	at	their	throats	there	was	nothing	kind	about	islam	it	was	a	religion	designed	for	thugs
you	can	blab	endlessly	about	love	but	you	defend	a	religion	of	hate	which	is	the	action	of	a	hater	namely	you
and	today	many	muslims	are	still	worthless	thugs	that	produce	nothing	they	are	either	rescued	by	oil	money	or	try	to	steal
with	it	's	jihad	cornerstone	islam	is	a	religion	that	was	designed	for	those	that	would	rather	loot	and	rape	for	a	living	than	work
you	claim	to	be	anti	religion	yet	you	spend	all	your	time	lying	for	the	benefit	of	islam	the	religion	of	hate
what	's	your	point	islam	declared	war	on	all	humanity	1400	years	ago	time	to	respond	in	kind
yes	you	can	lie	about	islam	all	you	want	and	you	can	deny	all	the	evidence	all	you	want	no	one	cares	about	opinion
even	your	own	link	shows	that	the	jews	were	the	producers	and	the	muslims	lived	by	stealing	others	property
have	they	told	the	tribe	yet	that	their	daughters	would	become	whores	for	sexual	jihad
islam	worships	a	phony	nonexistent	terrorist	god	they	would	be	better	off	worshiping	rocks
and	if	you	are	over	12	you	will	have	to	go	and	die	for	baghdadi	next	week
there	are	no	jews	in	saudi	or	many	of	the	gulf	states	because	the	muslims	exterminated	them
i	already	brought	you	proof	straight	from	my	qurans	if	you	refuse	to	read	it	then	shut	up	and	leave
mohammed	had	people	who	disagreed	with	him	murdered	isis	murders	the	same
furthermore	telling	people	that	they	should	be	tolerant	of	a	wholly	intolerant	religion	is	idiotic
the	fact	is	that	mohammed	was	every	bit	as	vile	and	sick	as	isis	he	is	their	model
sometimes	you	have	to	go	to	the	hadiths	to	clarify	the	quran
scum	bag	isis	supporters	will	say	anything	to	justify	their	barbaric	behavior
suddenly	the	daesh	murderers	of	children	pretend	to	care	about	children	but	it	's	just	propaganda
another	one	of	those	filthy	lies	muslims	love	to	tell	this	is	the	truth
do	you	have	a	way	to	kill	the	daesh	scum	that	are	hiding	behind	civilians	with	hurting	civilians
so	what	is	to	blame	for	the	more	than	100	islamist	terrorists	organizations	the	book	of	mormon
isis	practices	slavery	and	rape	mohamed	practiced	slavery	and	rape
then	when	there	was	no	one	left	to	rob	the	muslims	returned	to	being	dessert	bedouins	still	trying	to	rob	each	other
but	islam	is	the	source	and	dealing	with	the	symptom	accomplishes	zero	after	isis	and	the	rest	will	be	more
rt	the	assumption	that	is	just	another	religion	already	fooled	a	lot	of	ppl	islam	is	about	war	amp;world	domination	http
mohammed	was	an	imperialist	that	led	17	major	military	expeditions	isis	is	imperialist
isis	beheads	people	mohammed	beheaded	600	jews	in	one	day
rt	the	3	stages	of	the	islamic	demographic	jihad	=	gt
mohammed	was	a	caravan	robber	isis	steals	others	property
it	already	is	a	war	islam	has	been	at	war	for	1400	years	ignorant	cowardly	people	try	to	hide	from	the	fact
yeah	this	is	bad	they	should	take	isis	example	put	them	in	a	cage	and	torch	them	all
he	could	n't	be	close	to	the	idiot	you	are	terrorism	has	been	rampant	in	me	1400	years
mohammed	's	excuse	in	every	aggression	is	i	had	to	attack	because	i	heard	they	were	going	to	attack
but	the	truth	is	that	mohammed	followers	were	worthless	starving	thugs	that	produced	nothing	and	so	wanted	the	riches	of	khybar
let	people	read	the	quran	and	see	that	it	comes	from	hate
the	few	things	islam	came	up	with	were	from	conquered	people	and	came	in	spite	of	islam	not	because	of	it
you	lie	again	the	quran	and	hadith	do	tell	you	to	murder	non	believers
mohammed	was	a	slave	trader	who	owned	28	slaves
and	the	muslims	robbed	the	wealthy	merchants
need	i	say	more	destroy	islam	before	it	destroys	us
looks	like	you	are	the	ignorant	asshole	in	that	there	is	no	other	religion	that	has	close	to	that	number
yes	he	's	vile	because	he	is	against	a	religion	that	has	produced	more	than	100	terroris	groups
mohammed	later	attacked	the	jews	of	khybar	slaughtered	many	and	also	stole	their	property
wrong	jewish	tribe	microbrain	the	jews	of	khybar	had	nothing	to	do	with	mohammed
most	of	mohammed	's	17	military	expeditions	were	offensive
euclid	uses	algorithms	long	before	islam	existed	so	stop	with	the	garbage
opinions	are	opinions	far	more	jews	live	in	western	nations	than	where	they	originated
if	a	raped	woman	does	n't	have	four	witnesses	she	will	be	punished	further	under	islam
and	is	this	a	lie	that	westerners	created
the	jews	were	always	more	educated	and	productive	than	the	backward	muslims
i	'd	rather	deal	with	a	clown	hopped	up	on	mushrooms	than	a	muslim	filled	with	the	hatred	of	islam
and	muslims	have	much	higher	statistical	crime	rates	in	non	muslim	countries	than	the	non	muslims
islam	maintained	slavery	much	longer	than	christianity	and	only	gave	it	up	under	western	pressure
muslims	have	these	delusions	about	producing	algebra	but	many	others	beat	them	to	it
finally	the	backwards	effects	of	islam	ground	progress	in	muslim	countries	to	a	halt
furthermore	many	muslim	countries	do	n't	even	have	a	record	system	to	account	for	all	murders
and	for	the	last	1000	years	muslims	have	contributed	virtually	nothing	to	science
is	their	idea	of	fair	and	equal	representation	to	beat	peshmerga	to	death
which	is	why	he	gave	himself	as	many	wives	as	he	wanted	to	satisfy	his	prick
is	that	suppose	to	be	some	kind	of	stupid	excuse	for	the	barbarity	of	the	shia	militia

muslims	did	n't	invent	mathematics	greeks	and	indians	started	algebra	before	muslims
the	muslims	sold	the	slaves	mohammed	owned	28	slaves	quran	supports	slavery

they	do	n't	misinterpret	and	most	muslims	are	extremists
japan	was	the	original	aggressor	how	does	that	excuse	the	continuing	barbarity	of	islam
which	is	why	they	win	95	of	all	nobel	prizes	and	create	all	the	technology	that	muslims	use	and	were	too	stupid	to	invent
even	with	what	hitler	did	to	jews	still	more	want	to	live	in	the	west	than	under	hatefilled	islam
read	ibn	warraq	on	the	treatement	of	jews	and	other	minorities	in	muslim	history

those	muslim	states	survived	off	the	sweat	of	slaves	and	the	intellect	of	minorities
science	was	moving	forward	in	india	and	persia	before	islam	islam	only	slowed	it	down
why	have	n't	you	stopped	the	sick	muslims	from	trying	to	exterminate	israel

degrassie	is	not	a	historian
their	best	age	by	any	objective	measure	you	want	to	apply	is	now	in	secular	usa

and	notice	that	the	persian	culture	was	more	advanced	and	advancing	and	discovering	before	islam
a	word	of	advice	until	you	can	show	that	wikiislam	is	false	do	n't	bother	me	with	your	advice
yes	there	is	even	more	rape	in	muslim	countries	but	it	is	not	reported
every	day	we	see	that	muslims	hate	freedom	democracy	justice
yeah	they	could	use	camels	for	transport	abuse	and	rape	women	own	slaves	grovel	to	a	terrorist	god	pay	jizya	what	fun
mohammed	the	cancer	of	murder	hatred	slavery	bigotry	and	sexism	for	mankind
yes	the	muslims	murdered	80	million	indians
i	know	this	because	all	of	the	people	fighting	against	assad	now	are	islamofascists
you	only	have	to	count	the	corpses	to	see	that	islamic	extremism	is	widespread	jewish	not
mohammed	never	looked	for	knowledge	he	believed	in	jinn	was	illiterate	believed	dogs	ere	devil
there	was	no	muslim	golden	age	those	states	were	always	slave	states
it	's	called	reproductive	imperialism	and	was	first	advocated	by	their	pedophile	prophet
regarding	slavery	the	slaves	in	america	were	initially	sold	by	muslim	slavers	christians	got	rid	of	slavery	on	their	own
where	they	live	tells	you	everything	you	need	to	know	namely	that	islam	is	a	religion	of	bigotry
after	watching	the	shia	militia	beat	a	peshmerga	to	death	i	've	concluded	that	they	are	animals	just	like	isis
the	quran	is	not	a	history	book	all	of	it	is	instructions	to	man	for	all	time
that	is	the	fault	of	the	terrorist	who	are	hiding	behind	the	women	and	children	blame	them

what	an	incredible	piece	of	garbage	the	muslims	crusaded	against	the	christians	400	years	before	christian	crusades
rt	now	let	's	be	clear	it	's	not	the	minority	within	islam	that	believes	in	violence	against	blasphemers	it	's	the	majorit
i	just	gave	you	the	proof	from	the	quran	and	the	hadiths	that	you	are	lying
islam	is	the	religion	of	hatred	and	bigotry
islam	is	the	most	decisive	hatefilled	backward	thing	that	has	ever	happened	to	mankind
watching	shia	militia	beat	a	peshmerga	to	death	i	thought	praying	to	allah	5	times	a	day	certainly	peaks	the	level	of	fanatical	hatred
these	days	might	and	honor	come	from	science	technology	humanitarianism	which	is	why	muslims	wo	n't	get	any
yes	muslims	including	their	prophet	revel	in	their	illiteracy
because	most	of	them	are	muslims	and	most	are	impoverished
if	you	want	to	ignore	the	mountain	of	data	that	shows	islam	to	be	a	pile	of	crap	that	's	your	prob
democracy	only	means	that	people	get	to	elect	their	leaders	islam	means	they	are	ruled	by	freak	god
but	the	quran	and	hadith	make	it	clear	that	islam	is	imperialist
this	is	an	idiotic	study	made	with	an	objective	in	mind	terrorism	is	not	included	in	the	murder	rate
every	day	we	get	the	results	of	the	hatred	bred	by	islam
why	have	n't	you	and	your	world	stopped	over	100	islamic	terrorist	organizations	from	murdering	children
since	muslims	are	sworn	to	exterminate	them	why	should	n't	they
and	if	we	stop	assad	who	will	replace	him	but	a	bunch	of	islamofascists	that	are	even	worse

i	made	isis	rise	what	are	you	talking	about	islam	created	that	monster
you	are	comparing	a	few	thousand	jewish	extremists	with	a	few	million	muslim	extremists
did	they	should	god	is	great	did	they	burn	them	in	a	cage
we	are	suppose	to	believe	that	muslims	defended	themselves	all	the	way	to	europe	amp	india
hamas	has	been	launching	rockets	at	israel	forever
and	west	killed	the	guy	who	killed	the	6	million	jews	in	muslim	world	hitler	was	hero
muslims	rape	and	enslave	3000	ezidi	women	who	did	nothing	and	you	give	me	this
they	are	not	protected	under	islam	islam	declared	war	on	all	humanity	1400	years	ago
muslims	murdered	120	million	africans
your	prophet	moohammed	killed	children	when	he	used	catapults	to	attack	cities	so	why	are	you	complaining
for	every	jew	like	that	there	are	thousands	of	muslims	like	that
there	are	zero	lies	that	westerners	create	it	all	comes	from	your	own	quran	and	hadiths
and	while	christianity	moved	past	it	's	barbarity	islam	keeps	returning	to	it
furthermore	your	pedo	prophet	attacked	cities	with	catapults	killing	children	so	what	are	you	crying	about
yes	unlike	the	gulf	muslim	countries	where	they	still	behead	and	wo	n't	let	women	drive

islam	is	the	murder	of	280	million	citizens	of	the	earth	by	scum	shouting	allahu	akbar
but	the	western	world	gave	up	slavery	on	it	's	own	no	one	forced	them	from	the	outside

but	isis	never	attacked	muslims	like	they	did	ezidis	killing	them	as	non	believers
i	'm	talking	total	extermination	bragged	about	right	there	in	the	book
the	hypocrisy	of	islam	is	that	they	expect	to	convert	people	from	other	religions	but	they	murder	converts	from	their	own
because	while	other	groups	can	evolve	the	violence	of	the	quran	and	hadith	prevent	islam	from	ever	being	a	human	religion
if	you	are	a	muslim	and	if	you	have	actually	read	the	quran	then	you	have	to	be	a	total	liar
look	the	heroes	of	the	torah	exterminated	every	man	woman	child	and	animal	in	some	cities
islam	is	an	entire	religion	built	on	intolerance	and	jihad	it	's	time	for	the	world	to	stop	tolerating	it
how	many	muslims	there	are	is	irrelevant	the	declaration	of	war	on	mankind	is	clearly	spelled	out	in	quran	and	hadiths
let	's	stop	pretending	and	get	the	war	between	the	islamolunatics	and	the	rest	of	the	world	started	now
the	muslims	also	invaded	india	and	murdered	80	million	hindus	they	virtually	exterminated	all	buddhist	on	in	india
europe	needs	to	expel	their	muslim	immigrants
so	if	i	say	that	you	must	be	a	murdering	fascist	because	you	follow	that	book	am	i	right
those	jews	are	assholes	most	jews	are	secular	and	humanist	most	muslims	are	islamists

nobody	cares	about	your	stupid	rationalizations	we	are	simple	going	to	kill	all	the	daesh	hope	you	are	one	of	em
so	if	you	are	against	slavery	you	can	not	be	a	muslim	so	why	are	you	crying	about	slavery	when	the	quran	approves	it
now	muslim	terror	groups	are	trying	to	complete	the	job	of	killing	or	throwing	out	any	remaining	minority	groups	in	arabia
unfortunately	real	islam	as	defined	in	the	quran	and	hadith	is	too	backwards	and	inhuman	even	for	most	me	muslims
islam	has	never	been	a	resistance	to	oppression	it	has	always	been	source	of	oppression	to	both	believers	and	non	believer
this	coming	from	a	muslim	hypocrite	-the	religion	that	declared	war	on	humanity	and	are	population	imperialists
a	shit	sucking	muslim	bigot	like	you	would	n't	recognize	history	if	it	crawled	up	your	cunt	you	think	photoshop	is	a	truth	machin
and	now	every	jihadi	group	wants	to	reinstate	slavery	in	the	present	because	the	quran	approves	it	and	mohammed	practiced
of	course	that	is	because	islam	is	a	religion	of	murder	and	other	muslims	are	in	rifle	range
problem	with	vile	muslims	is	that	they	try	to	rationalize	amp	excuse	the	crimes	of	islam	rather	than	get	rid	of	them
actually	muslims	enslaved	far	more	than	anyone	else	the	prophet	mohammed	was	a	slave	trader	jesus	had	no	slaves
islam	is	a	hate	mongering	death	cult	that	declared	war	on	humanity	that	fact	should	be	talked	about
rt	the	logic	of	islam	reflects	clearly	in	those	who	follow	its	ideology	and	oaths	to	be	muhammad	's	slave
furthermore	the	muslims	were	the	last	to	give	up	slavery	and	many	only	did	it	under	pressure	from	the	west
and	since	islam	declared	war	on	all	humanity	humanity	must	return	the	favor	and	declare	war	on	islam
islam	is	a	slave	religion	both	for	it	's	followers	and	for	the	people	it	enslaves	and	for	the	dhimmis	it	rules
every	religion	and	non	religion	on	the	planet	is	at	war	with	islam	every	border	with	a	muslim	state	is	a	bloody	border
no	minorities	of	any	kind	are	left	in	saudi	and	several	other	gulf	states	having	been	exterminated	by	muslims
the	muslims	conquered	2/3	of	the	christian	world	before	it	attacked	back	so	again	what	are	you	crying	about
so	let	's	get	it	over	with	the	world	needs	to	declare	war	on	islam	and	get	rid	of	the	cancer
this	is	kiddie	stuff	compared	to	what	muslims	do	every	day
what	are	you	talking	about	provocation	islam	declared	war	with	the	world	that	is	more	than	enough	provocation
the	muslims	attacked	and	murdered	the	zoastrians	in	persia	and	the	buddhists	in	afghanistan
you	dumb	asshole	he	legalized	slavery	he	raped	slave	girls	he	was	a	pedophile	how	can	you	call	him	great	anything
killing	people	because	they	believe	differently	than	you	and	express	that	is	not	an	excuse	for	murder	except	among	muslims
wrong	apostacy	is	the	equivalent	of	leaving	america	and	becoming	a	citizen	of	another	country	there	is	no	penalty
but	your	whole	conversation	about	slavery	is	phony	bull	shit	propaganda	since	you	follow	a	slave	owner	prophet
the	jews	are	trying	to	defend	themselves	against	muslims	trying	to	exterminate	them
islam	has	hadiths	that	tell	you	what	hand	to	use	to	wipe	your	ass	there	is	zero	room	for	individualism	in	it
i	have	no	fear	of	idiots	like	you	at	all	what	turns	my	stomach	is	the	destruction	to	freedom	and	humanity	that	islam	causes

islam	is	the	most	genocidal	religion	on	the	planet	mankind	must	exterminate	islam	or	be	exterminated	by	it
good	we	have	established	that	muslims	are	slavers	and	that	their	humanity	has	failed	to	evolve	past	slave	owning
roflmao	where	is	the	picture	daeshbag
the	world	is	doing	nothing	islam	is	producing	the	terrorist	activities	and	has	been	for	1400	years
islam	declared	war	on	all	mankind	1400	years	ago	now	we	return	the	favor
islam	was	made	for	stupid	violent	lying	criminal	useless	thugs	and	you	fill	the	bill	exactly
how	long	before	some	idiot	politician	tells	us	that	this	is	not	about	islam	but	about	some	islamic	extremist
muslims	invaded	and	conquered	2/3	of	christianity	before	christians	responded	so	stick	your	lies
and	if	muslims	are	angry	that	they	ca	n't	force	islam	on	people	who	cares
and	looking	at	your	page	i	can	see	that	you	are	in	the	business	of	photoshopping	images	islamist	cocksucker
it	's	muslims	that	do	virtually	all	the	killing	for	example	80	of	civilians	killed	in	afghanistan	are	killed	by	taliban
i	would	n't	be	too	concerned	about	that	because	outside	the	canon	of	islam	there	is	no	historical	evidence	of	mohammed
the	asshole	prophet	mohammed	who	was	a	slave	trader	pedophile	murderer	war	monger	sexist	bigot	caravan	robber
i	'm	totally	sick	of	these	politically	expedient	statements	after	every	attack	by	islam	on	humanity
again	you	are	the	liar	muslims	invaded	europe	400	years	before	the	crusades
yes	the	western	world	was	unaware	of	the	layer	of	islamolunatics	that	lived	under	the	thumbs	of	the	dictators
you	can	stop	the	one	muslim	nonsense	look	at	what	the	muslims	tell	the	pollsters
the	lesson	the	world	learned	about	islam	is	that	when	we	get	rid	of	their	brutal	dictators	they	are	replaced	by	brutal	islamists
why	would	i	care	about	the	opinion	of	a	guy	who	follows	a	pedophile	prophet
this	is	why	the	world	knows	that	muslims	are	taqiyya	liars	that	manufacture	fraudulent	data
ask	the	muslims	they	are	the	ones	killing	all	the	jews
may	allah	bless	him	with	72	virgin	pigs
it	's	not	a	prophet	competition	it	's	about	following	a	fraud	who	owned	slaves	had	people	murdered	was	a	bigot	etc
that	's	how	muslims	react	when	the	traffic	light	turns	red
the	muslims	think	that	lying	is	the	greatest	of	all	virtues	after	genocide
yeah	break	relations	with	the	only	me	democracy	that	the	muslims	are	trying	to	exterminate	smart
the	difference	is	that	islam	has	a	requirement	for	jihad	has	over	100	large	terrorist	orgs	and	declared	war	on	world
not	nearly	to	the	extent	that	they	went	insane	over	a	mohammed	cartoon
and	furthermore	they	murder	anyone	who	tries	to	convert	a	muslim	but	demand	the	freedom	to	convert	non	muslims
it	's	not	about	a	single	terrorist	there	are	an	endless	supply	of	them	it	's	about	a	hate	cult	called	islam
these	morons	that	you	show	talking	about	mohammed	give	no	facts	and	knew	nothing	about	him
isis	continues	their	big	successes	against	unarmed	civilians	they	just	ca	n't	win	a	fight	against	anything	but	families
and	some	idiots	want	to	support	the	muslims	that	are	trying	to	exterminate	israel
good	tweet	but	they	actually	start	selling	their	daughters	at	9
by	practicing	islam	you	are	vomiting	on	all	jews	christians	and	non	believers	check	code	of	umar
furthermore	your	heroes	the	taliban	are	responsible	for	the	murder	of	80	of	afghan	civilians	so	stick	it	asshole
the	fact	that	there	were	two	layers	of	evil	to	be	dealt	with	in	iraq	does	n't	mean	they	should	both	be	left	alone
the	muslims	are	the	crusaders	microbrain
the	point	is	about	what	the	society	supports	and	what	it	does	not	support	barbarity	is	not	an	aberration	in	muslim	society
outlaw	islam
yeah	i	read	that	and	every	verse	of	the	tao	te	ching	is	superior	to	every	verse	of	the	quran	so	quran	is	fraud
the	sunni	turkmen	are	genocidal	criminals	living	off	loot	they	stole	from	minorities	what	they	want	counts	for	nothing
if	you	want	to	understand	isis	understand	islam	they	are	exactly	the	same
islam	created	that	monster	and	islam	has	been	creating	them	for	1400	years
99	of	the	time	you	muslims	play	the	victim	card	it	's	a	lie	and	the	reverse	is	true
yeah	and	do	n't	you	waste	your	time	hating	homophones	sexists	and	racists	are	you	going	to	do	that
so	if	a	buddhist	owns	a	slave	you	can	say	that	he	goes	against	his	religion	but	a	muslim	slave	owner	is	not	going	against	his
the	quran	is	an	incoherent	piece	of	garbage	created	for	mental	midgets
it	's	basically	an	empty	excuse	that	leftists	and	muslims	use	for	their	anti	us	bigotry
who	cares	if	it	has	been	revised	a	million	times	what	does	that	have	to	do	with	the	barbarity	of	islam
erdogan	is	a	fascist	islamist	scum	bag	women	's	employment	has	decreased	30	under	him	violence	against	women	has	increased
rt	proper	grammer	islam	phobia	is	not	a	medical	condition	it	is	truth
i	'm	telling	you	that	the	religion	of	islam	is	guilty	of	the	murder	of	280	million	citizens	of	the	earth	and	i	will	not
and	if	someone	risks	their	life	to	save	me	from	a	mass	grave	they	are	welcome	to	my	tv	and	toaster
pigs	like	you	never	whine	so	loud	at	the	hundreds	of	murders	by	muslims	every	day	around	the	world
yes	all	that	islam	is	making	isis	so	loving	idiot
anything	an	american	does	defines	america	anything	a	muslim	does	is	an	aberration	idiot
the	great	left	lie	is	that	it	's	just	a	handful	of	extremists
the	jihadists	fight	for	the	interest	of	the	caliph	and	the	pedophile	prophet	not	for	the	interest	of	the	people

rt	mt	is	now	the	only	major	muslim	majority	country	in	the	middle	east	that	is	not	bombing
whatever	happens	in	when	it	is	over	the	country	will	be	in	the	hands	of	one	islamofascist	group	or	another
by	hating	the	ideaology	that	enables	it	that	is	what	i	'm	doing
unlike	you	i	do	read	before	making	assumptions	i	read	all	of	the	quran	and	many	of	the	hadiths	that	is	how	i	know	it	's	vile
read	the	statistics	microbrain	look	at	the	percentage	of	the	worlds	muslims	that	want	to	kill	apostates
rt	my	point	is	that	mohammeds	example	us	used	by	some	muslim	men	to	justify	their	paedophilia
the	saudis	will	arm	sunni	rebels	in	yemen	civil	war	is	inevitable
the	parallel	between	the	behavior	of	terrorist	organizations	and	the	prophet	mohammed	is	something	i	've	preached	for	15	year
mohammed	led	17	military	expeditions	beheaded	600	jews	in	one	day	married	a	six	year	old	girl	etc	etc	get	the	picture
saudi	cleric	believes	earth	does	not	revolve	around	sun	there	must	be	50	ways	to	return	to	the	7th	century	with	as	your	expert	guide
the	followers	of	the	religion	give	a	shit	about	the	prophet	of	the	religion	he	is	their	example	and	always	will	be
not	masked	the	quran	and	the	hadith	declared	war	on	humanity	1400	years	ago
eventually	followed	by	no	future	for	christians	in	uk	eventually	followed	by	no	future	for	atheists	in	uk
one	way	of	helping	to	prevent	such	crimes	would	be	to	outlaw	the	sick	and	sexist	religion	of	islam	that	victimizes	women
as	long	as	the	middle	east	is	in	the	grip	of	there	will	never	be	such	a	thing	as	an	arab	spring
that	's	just	as	big	a	fallacy	as	the	oil	fallacy	the	us	had	zero	to	do	with	the	creation	of	al	queda
rt	obama	implies	murder	of	3	muslims	in	nc	is	religious	bigotry	but	terrorists	slaughtering	jews	in	a	paris	kosher	deli	is	a
no	islam	declared	war	on	all	humanity	1400	years	ago	so	all	non	believers	despise	islam
islam	can	not	be	reformed	because	it	's	vileness	is	too	deep	in	the	religion
mohammed	was	a	murderer	jesus	was	n't	mohammed	was	a	rapist	jesus	was	n't
islam	was	designed	to	benefit	7th	cent	bedouin	thugs	rapist	murderers	slavers	caravan	robbers
and	the	christian	world	got	rid	of	slavery	by	itself	the	muslim	world	was	pressured	into	getting	rid	of	it	and	now	returns	to	it
chomsky	is	a	racist	islam	created	isis
why	do	2/3	of	all	muslims	want	sharia	which	demands	death	for	homosexuals	and	apostates
wrong	they	were	connected	to	the	muslim	brotherhood	and	they	were	anti	semitic	bigots
i	read	the	entire	quran	and	much	of	the	hadiths	i	know	more	about	islam	than	most	muslims	it	is	a	curse	to	all	mankind
there	is	no	difference	in	what	the	prophet	mohammed	did	and	in	what	isis	does
sure	why	do	one	third	of	muslims	want	to	murder	people	who	want	to	leave	islam
saudi	would	be	a	big	joke	if	it	was	n't	crushing	the	lives	of	millions	of	people
a	religion	who	has	a	murdering	hating	pedophile	at	it	's	core	has	no	room	to	be	reformed
because	more	slavery	exists	in	the	islamic	world	than	anywhere	else	and	i	am	very	much	against	n.	korea
buddha	said	that	slavery	was	unacceptable	1100	years	before	the	slave	trader	mohammed	came	along
again	why	should	n't	everybody	hate	islam
i	've	seen	it	before	microbrain	i	just	told	you	every	verse	of	the	tao	te	ching	is	superior	to	every	verse	of	quran
actually	they	follow	the	quran	and	the	hadiths	exactly	it	's	the	moderate	muslims	who	ignore	much	of	their	canon
but	islam	keeps	trying	to	return	to	the	7th	century
on	the	contrary	the	brutal	bigoted	sexist	god	of	islam	encourages	the	abuse	of	women
rt	after	the	recent	rape	murder	case	of	a	female	turkish	student	other	turkish	women	are	telling	their	stories	to	the	worl
have	some	pc	pandered	tell	me	to	accept	a	cult	of	hate
and	how	about	if	we	investigate	the	hate	speech	in	the	quran
because	christianity	is	dying	out	and	the	christian	world	has	reformed	itself
but	there	are	thousands	of	lone	nut	cases	all	motivated	by	islam
if	you	do	n't	think	that	muslims	invaded	christianity	and	europe	first	you	are	to	historically	ignorant

rt	no	compulsion	in	religion	qu'ran	2:256	think	again
islam	is	not	a	race	microbrain	it	is	a	religion	you	can	always	tell	a	leftist	because	when	he	runs	out	of	arguments	he
islam	is	the	perpetuity	of	oppression	and	i	thank	isis	for	helping	the	world	to	kill	islam
this	means	that	if	you	want	to	establish	a	humanist	ideaology	islam	will	get	in	the	way	much	more	than	buddhism
the	question	is	how	hard	should	we	work	to	keep	the	muslims	from	killing	each	other	since	they	seem	so	determined	to	continue
mohammed	was	a	slave	trader	jesus	was	n't	mohammed	was	a	sexist	jesus	was	n't
rt	being	nice	2	islam	is	like	hugging	a	serial	killer	and	thinking	he	will	stop	bur
again	you	are	an	idiot	others	did	bad	things	so	we	have	to	ignore	the	barbarity	of	islam
there	is	no	comparing	the	vileness	of	mohammed	to	jesus	or	buddha	or	lao	tse	he	was	simply	a	criminal
islamophobia	is	like	the	idea	of	naziphobia	islam	is	a	religion	of	hate	and	it	must	be	outlawed
after	committing	genocide	and	murdering	countless	civilians	scum	bag	deash	try	to	use	babies	for	propaganda
what	matters	is	that	people	like	you	are	trying	to	lay	a	guilt	trip	on	us	while	ignoring	the	truth
there	are	over	100	islamic	terrorist	organizations	kkk	virtually	dead	there	is	no	canceling	out
and	he	was	also	a	total	fraud	he	made	up	the	verses	of	the	quran	when	he	needed	them	as	he	needed

and	83:25	says	they	drink	wine	in	heaven	so	islamic	heaven	is	basically	a	drunken	whore	house	very	spiritual	lol
so	tell	me	what	could	possible	happen	that	you	would	consider	to	be	proof	that	allah	and	mohammed	were	frauds
you	are	defending	the	prophet	mohammed	and	he	was	a	murderer	sexist	imperialist	and	bigot
child	abuse	is	illegal	in	western	culture	it	is	accepted	in	islamic	cultures	because	their	prophet

not	only	do	that	but	they	can	dump	their	wives	leaving	them	nothing	by	saying	three	times	i	divorce	you	barbaric
as	long	as	it	's	not	an	islamolunatic	in	power	that	forces	sharia	on	people	who	do	n't	want	it	who	cares
islamophobia	fear	of	this
the	apharthide	is	a	muslim	thing	they	have	exterminated	jews	and	christians	in	most	of	me
maybe	the	media	did	n't	have	space	after	reporting	the	about	the	thousands	murdered	by	muslims	that	week
the	intellect	of	a	muslim	cretin	who	thinks	allah	made	all	mankind	so	one	part	could	make	war	on	another
and	the	quran	says	that	the	muslims	must	steal	and	occupy	the	entire	world
you	are	lying	again	just	like	a	muslim	the	quran	approves	of	raping	slave	girls	explicitly
i	know	that	the	terrorist	organization	hamas	has	not	had	another	election	since	their	first	one
saying	that	islam	is	a	way	of	life	means	that	it	tells	you	that	you	can	not	have	democracy	and	must	instead	follow	a	pedophile
considering	what	those	local	arabs	did	to	kurds	christians	assyrians	ezidiz	etc	who	cares
the	reason	why	mohammed	's	thugs	went	to	war	was	to	get	what	they	could	steal
1400	years	ago	islam	stole	all	women	's	rights	and	turned	them	into	slaves	forever
true	and	most	of	them	were	from	well	off	families	and	their	radicalization	follows	their	increased	attendance	at	mosques
the	hadiths	are	the	sunnah	of	the	prophet	microbrain	so	you	ca	n't	throw	out	the	ones	you	do	n't	like
islamophobia	is	like	naziphobia	it	's	an	abuse	of	language	for	political	gain	it	looks	like	this
you	are	the	one	who	believes	in	a	god	that	asks	one	part	of	his	creation	to	murder	another	part	impossible	to	get	any	stupider
people	who	hate	the	nazis	are	not	extremists	and	there	is	no	diff	between	islam	and	nazis
islamophobia	fear	of	this
no	the	money	comes	from	muslims	around	the	world	who	want	a	caliphate	and	the	domination	of	islam	by	force
and	no	doubt	your	friend	was	every	place	where	isis	could	have	been	murdering	children
islamophobia	fear	of	this
i	know	that	the	palestinians	are	a	group	of	murdering	terrorists	that	provide	no	human	rights	to	their	population
but	in	islam	they	can	rape	captive	women	to	their	hearts	content	and	there	is	no	law	against	it
female	engineers	make	1.17	comp	to	male	engineers	so	without	specific	professional	comparisons	your	info	is	useless
again	you	are	a	muslim	liar	mohammed	said	nothing	about	stray	and	most	civilized	countries	try	to	find	strays	homes
fighting	along	side	anyone	in	the	me	makes	you	someone	else	's	enemy	regardless	of	the	motivation	their	problem	not	ours
saying	that	islam	is	a	way	of	life	means	that	islam	actually	tells	you	which	hand	to	use	to	wipe	your	ass
i	know	that	they	have	the	same	policy	of	breeding	like	rats	and	population	imperialism	as	their	prophet	mohammed
lol	first	you	deny	that	islam	permits	the	rape	of	slave	girls	then	you	verify	it	get	lost	i	'm	tired	of	you

good	anything	is	better	than	having	islamofascists	in	power
there	is	no	such	thing	as	islamophobia	that	is	like	saying	there	is	naziphobia
i	'm	not	interested	in	your	sectarian	divisions	shia	and	sunni	are	all	following	the	vile	pedophile	prophet
if	is	so	against	idols	that	they	smash	assyrian	and	buddhists	statues	then	why	do	they	pray	at	mecca	and	circumambulate	the	kabba
rt	islam	is	in	the	news	everyday	not	for	good	works	but	for	it	's	savage	evil
islam	declared	war	on	all	humanity	1400	years	ago	while	individual	muslims	may	or	may	not	be	terrorist	islam	is	terrorist
they	are	not	as	stupid	as	you	since	islam	is	not	a	race
no	matter	how	desperately	race	baiting	trash	like	you	want	islam	to	be	a	race	it	's	not

both	the	muslim	men	and	their	religious	texts	abuse	women
one	of	the	vile	things	about	islam	is	that	it	murders	people	for	exercising	their	freedom	of	speech
i	read	the	entire	quran	and	many	of	the	hadiths	and	murdering	unbelievers	and	forcing	islam	on	people	is	exactly	what	it	is
so	why	does	n't	blumenthal	go	and	ask	hamas	why	they	never	have	elections
maybe	they	are	not	that	anxious	to	have	a	bigot	like	blumenthal	encourage	even	more	muslims	to	murder	more	jews	in	france
so	which	ones	are	the	moderate	muslims
normally	dress	should	be	a	personal	choice	in	islam	it	is	a	symbol	of	oppression

the	majority	of	muslims	have	already	shown	themselves	to	be	radical	in	polls
that	list	of	crimes	describes	what	muslims	have	been	doing	to	jews	in	the	me	for	1400	years
balance	what	the	hate	cult	of	islam	has	zero	place	in	american	schools
the	term	islamophobia	is	like	the	term	naziphobia	stupid

did	he	embrace	buddhism	or	christianity	or	hinduism	and	become	a	terrorist	no	it	's	always	islam	that	leads	to	terrorism
here	is	the	quran	telling	men	they	can	beat	their	wives	and	that	men	are	superior
islam	only	served	to	slow	down	science	the	few	discoveries	by	muslims	were	despite	islam	not	because	of	islam
m	mohammed	told	muslims	to	take	over	all	of	the	arabian	penninsula	from	jews	and	christians
but	all	the	crimes	of	islam	are	exactly	according	to	their	beliefs
the	poor	women	do	it	because	they	marry	a	muslim	man	and	are	pressured	into	it	men	do	it	in	prison	it	's	a	criminal	's	relig
m	yes	i	hate	nazis	too	got	a	problem	with	that
isis	follows	the	quran	and	hadiths	exactly	they	follow	the	sunnah	exactly	the	evil	is	in	the	quran	and	hadiths
the	quran	approves	of	the	beating	of	women	and	tells	them	to	stay	home	so	isis	does	it	also
why	not	the	palestinians	behead	gays	and	honor	kill	women
true	but	islam	is	corrupt	from	the	beginning
the	muslims	killed	millions	when	they	entered	europe	and	india	but	the	question	is	can	we	get	beyond	barbaric	religion
the	shia	militia	are	terrorists	that	are	only	slightly	better	than	isis	look	at	the	shia	militia	in	yemen
you	should	be	attacking	everyone	that	follows	a	religious	cult	of	hated	and	murder	like	islam
an	islamist	human	rights	group	lol	now	there	is	a	contradiction	in	terms
iran	where	there	is	no	human	freedom	and	where	they	murder	kurds	gays	apostates	political	opponents
okay	so	we	understand	that	the	quran	makes	striking	a	woman	an	option	and	that	the	woman	must	obey	the	man
islam	declared	war	on	all	humanity	1400	years	ago	and	denying	it	is	simply	a	lie
good	morning	here	is	the	history	of	islamic	slavery
m	i	hate	islam	because	it	is	a	religion	based	on	hatred	and	jihad
i	'm	not	concerned	with	single	events	i	'm	concerned	with	1400	years	of	islamic	murder	and	barbarity	that	shows	no	sign	of	ending
m	and	muslims	today	are	as	determined	to	do	that	as	every	generation	before	them
but	islam	is	proud	of	their	slavery	imperialism	and	genocide	against	minorities	the	are	murdering	kurds	in	iran	now
yeap	this	is	a	big	problem	the	shia	militia	is	only	slightly	less	fanatical	and	islamofascist	than	the	daesh	they	are	replacing
it	means	god	is	great	often	shouted	while	muslims	are	murdering	one	of	gods	creations
islam	teaches	exactly	what	isis	practices
two	verses	and	we	can	agree	that	islam	tells	women	to	stay	home	cover	up	obey	your	husband	right
mohammed	was	a	slave	trader	caravan	robber	murderer	beheader	rapist	sexist	bigot	liar	and	pedophile	just	like	isis
saudis	regard	isis	as	a	threat	it	's	who	is	defeating	them	that	they	have	a	problem	with
mohammed	's	first	wife	katjia	was	a	wealthy	woman	before	islam	so	you	are	lying
mohammed	raped	aishia	when	she	was	9
yes	let	's	try	to	fool	people	into	believing	a	lie	that	is	a	religion	of	peace
denouncing	terrorism	and	violence	means	denouncing	the	heart	of	islam
my	2:282	says	that	you	can	replace	the	testimony	of	one	man	with	that	of	two	women
mohammed	was	suppose	to	be	guided	by	god	and	his	example	was	for	all	mankind	for	all	time	he	was	not	suppose	to	follow
islam	allows	men	divorce	by	saying	i	divorce	you	three	times	not	women
actual	muslims	know	very	little	about	islam
m	hamas	throws	their	political	opponents	off	roof	tops	is	that	your	idea	of	humanity
fuck	the	quran
okay	so	we	agree	that	the	taliban	and	isis	and	saudis	are	implementing	33:33
both	daesh	and	shia	militia	are	driven	by	a	religion	of	hatred	and	bigotry	and	there	will	be	no	freedom	in	tikrit	regardless
m	no	it	is	the	muslims	that	have	done	the	ethnic	cleansing	for	1400	years	israel	is	putting	a	stop	to	it
being	able	to	practice	their	religion	does	n't	mean	that	they	were	not	treated	as	third	class	citizens
liar	katjia	was	a	business	woman	before	there	was	islam	mohammed	worked	for	her	and	had	no	choice	about	it
isis	beheads	people	saudi	beheads	people	mohammed	beheaded	600	jews
laugh	all	you	want	islam	is	a	steaming	pile	of	shit	good	night	blocked
but	the	christian	and	jewish	world	had	an	enlightenment	because	they	got	past	religion	islamic	world	has	never	got	past	religion
fuck	mohammed	was	a	pedophile	murderer	bigot	sexist	rapist	slave	trader	caravan	robber	and	liar
i	have	three	translations	of	the	quran	microbrain	and	i	know	far	more	about	islam	than	you
rt	.@maxblumenthal	resents	that	journalists	are	reporting	on	the	antisemitism	by	bdsers	at	ucla	bad	press	for	the	bds	mvmt
m	forget	about	your	anti	jewish	bigotry	how	do	you	explain	hamas	beheading	gays	and	honor	killing	women
you	try	again	mohammed	screwed	aisha	when	she	was	9
mohammed	was	a	slave	owner	and	the	quran	allows	slavery	so	isis	returns	to	slavery
horseshit	mohammed	led	17	major	military	expeditions	owned	28	slaves	had	9	wives	one	six	years	old
the	women	convert	to	islam	because	they	marry	muslim	men	men	convert	in	prison
and	by	the	way	the	entire	world	hates	islam
your	prophet	never	said	that	and	countries	like	pakistan	have	a	90	domestic	violence	rate
80	of	muslim	civilians	are	killed	by	taliban	look	it	up
if	you	actually	knew	about	islam	you	would	know	how	violent	and	barbaric
here	is	the	quran	telling	muslim	men	that	they	can	rape	their	slave	girls
what	is	the	difference	between	what	isis	does	and	what	the	prophet	mohammed	did	microbrain
here	is	the	quran	telling	women	not	to	leave	their	house
islam	only	talked	about	the	freeing	of	slaves	who	were	muslims	since	mohammed	was	a	slave	owner	it	continued	to	today	good	night
m	yeah	being	anti	zionist	is	pretending	to	have	an	excuse	for	being	anti	semitic
do	uk	enough	to	understand	the	history	of	islamic	slavery
i	typed	that	on	there	the	hadiths	are	original	shut	up	and	go	look	them	up	or	are	you	afraid	to
while	the	palestinian	terrorists	that	blumenthal	loves	are	throwing	their	opponents	off	rooftops	and	really	beheading	gays
palestinians	are	half	egyptian	and	half	saudi	palestinians	are	the	spearhead	for	the	arabs	against	the	jews
that	tiny	group	is	dripping	cluelessness	all	over	the	floor	oh	please	love	me	for	my	brainwashed	anti	semitism
nobody	on	the	supreme	court	had	a	clue	about	what	a	murdering	raping	bigoted	pedophile	he	was
of	course	muslim	religious	bigots	like	you	think	that	is	okay
and	you	are	supporting	the	little	head	choppers	and	honor	killers	in	palestine
the	very	definition	of	islam	is	hatred	and	negativity	we	have	to	get	rid	of	that	cancer	so	civilization	can	advance
half	of	saudi	women	are	beaten	at	home	because	the	quran	permits	it
why	do	muslims	force	women	to	cover	up	and	stay	at	home	the	quran	tells	them	to
i	know	you	ca	n't	go	on	a	date	with	any	man	you	want
the	content	of	the	quran	and	hadiths	give	islam	a	bad	name
the	filth	of	the	palestinian	head	choppers	and	honor	killers	and	genocidal	maniacs	is	there	for	the	world	to	see
blumenthal	's	silence	on	the	muslim	jihad	against	humanity	and	it	's	cost

rt	.@vsramchandra	islam	=	nazism	how	could	it	be	reformed
the	racist	are	muslims	who	use	breeding	for	population	imperialism
with	muslims	attacking	european	jews	and	grooming	european	children	get	rid	of	them
nothing	has	any	value	for	arabs	except	the	destruction	of	the	jews	and	the	arabs	must	pay	palestine	to	destroy	em
my	opinions	of	islam	do	n't	come	from	the	media	they	come	from	the	quran	and	hadiths
but	your	child	raping	prophet	made	his	intentions	clearly	known	in	the	hadiths
hey	should	n't	you	be	worrying	more	about	pakistan	muslims	murdering	christians	amp	hindus
want	to	see	totally	insane	rantings	look	at	bloomenthal	's	terrorist	friends
that	's	because	the	standard	of	comparison	is	to	murdering	muslims
and	in	the	meantime	the	palestinian	fuckers	are	beheading	gays	and	doing	honor	killings
the	problem	is	that	i	have	far	more	knowledge	of	islam	than	you	and	it	is	your	mind	that	has	been	shrunken	by	islam
any	fool	can	see	that	is	a	photoshop	job	goat	fucker
and	the	muslim	nazis	left	the	jews	nothing	but	this
islam	is	not	a	race	microbrain	it	is	a	death	cult
because	they	use	their	women	as	baby	machines	and	they	practice	population	imperialism	as	commanded	by	mohammed
it	's	nothing	compared	to	muslim	pakistani	mobs	murdering	christians	and	hindus	on	fake	blasphemy
they	are	occupied	because	arab	muslims	want	jews	exterminated
in	the	quran	islam	declared	war	on	all	mankind	1400	years	ago	it	is	time	for	humanity	to	return	the	favor
rt	israel	withdrew	gaza	2005	evidently	is	so	far	up	your	ass	you	're	choking

same	time	admiring	the	ottoman	state	which	was	a	total	authoritarian	slave	state
these	muslims	are	babies	are	trained	to	kill	scum
no	israel	is	containing	muslim	violence	through	the	only	thing	muslims	respond	to	violence
if	they	were	aligned	with	neo	nazis	the	muslims	would	love	them
and	it	is	islam	's	preoccupation	with	violent	victory	rather	than	persuasion	that	makes	it	globally	hated
i	know	you	have	religious	police	telling	how	to	dress
where	is	your	evidence	that	they	are	furious	goat	fucker
lol	with	conspiracy	theories	like	that	are	you	sure	that	you	are	n't	a	madrassa	graduate
if	you	walked	down	saudi	street	dressed	like	in	yr	picture	would	be	arrested
shows	how	stupid	you	've	become	only	muslim	terrorists	actually	attack	talks
as	this	palestinian	makes	clear	they	are	egyptians	and	saudis	and	that	arabs	must	destroy	jews
now	the	muslim	arabs	are	using	the	palestinans	as	their	spear	point	to	complete	the	extermination
the	english	amp	israel	were	really	thinking	ahead	when	they	sent	baghdadi	to	all	those	islamic	religious	schools
the	jews	lived	on	40	of	the	arabian	penninsula	before	the	pedophile	prophet	started	to	murder	them
blumenthal	's	silence	on	muslim	bigotry	and	it	's	cost

no	it	does	n't	suggest	that	islamolunatics	and	left	wing	lunatics	suggest	that
raping	9	year	old	girls	is	allowed	in	islam	so	where	are	child	soldiers	outlawed

compare	a	netanyahu	speech	to	this	genocidal	palestinian	lunatic
at	least	i	do	n't	follow	pedophile	prophets	or	believe	in	mythical	creatures	of	fire	called	jinn
your	people	's	struggle	is	to	dominate	other	people	through	violence	so	fuck	you
why	when	he	could	be	elected	mayor	of	peshwar	in	a	heartbeat	he	could	then	murder	christians	for	blasphemy
blumenthal	self	promotion	the	only	groups	that	attack	talks	and	kill	people	are	max	's	terrorist	muslim	friends
but	look	at	the	reality	disconnect	burak	says	he	is	for	freedom	and	against	all	slavery	while	at	the
and	since	islam	is	a	religion	of	murder	bigotry	and	hatred	hating	islam	is	rational
a	phobia	is	an	irrational	hatred	there	is	no	such	thing	as	a	phobia	for	a	hatred	that	is	rational
muslims	are	trying	hard	to	finish	the	job	of	genocide	that	their	prophet	mohammed	gave	them
so	the	entire	nation	of	saudi	should	be	punnished	since	they	do	n't	allow	churches	or	bibles
because	there	are	no	zionist	thugs	just	people	protecting	themselves	from	muslim	head	choppers
the	prophet	mohammed	beheaded	600	jews	for	not	being	loyal	to	him	and	all	the	muslims	love	mohammed	so	what	's	the	problem
no	the	muslims	murdered	the	jews	the	traditional	muslim	way	with	swords	knives	and	spears	and	they	did	it	for	1400	years
your	proph	beheaded	600	jewish	men	amp	sold	the	women	and	children	into	slavery	and	you	love	him
rt	australia	gifted	teen	embraces	islam	becomes	a	jihad	terrorist

here	r	translations	of	t	quranic	verse	that	gives	men	the	right	to	beat	their	wives	and	declares	men	superior
nobody	said	that	goat	fucker	you	made	it	up
so	of	course	muslims	are	caught	in	a	corner	having	to	make	conspiracy	theories	to	try	to	protect	islam
virtually	all	the	women	being	beaten	and	tortured	in	the	world	are	getting	it	from	muslims
by	all	means	send	the	muslims	back	to	the	middle	east	before	they	turn	europe	into	the	same	sewer
hey	at	least	he	does	n't	murder	people	for	apostacy	and	blasphemy	like	your	tribe	of	scum
kind	of	like	the	islamic	world	is	a	prison
the	prophet	mohammed	did	the	same	thing	baghdadi	can	quote	quran	and	hadiths	for	every	action	he	takes
talk	to	me	about	being	dumb	when	you	figure	out	how	to	get	working	toilets	into	the	pakistani	public	schools
wrong	again	islam	=	nazism	and	muslim	murderers	have	exterminated	jews
but	islam	has	no	truth	every	word	is	a	lie
isis	is	a	giant	embarrassment	to	muslims	not	just	because	of	the	barbaric	things	they	do	but	because
look	at	this	ranting	lunatic	palestinian	interesting	what	he	tells	us

b.	the	only	reason	there	are	non	muslims	on	the	earth	is	because	the	non	muslim	armies	defeated	the	muslims
but	why	propagandize	your	bigotry	when	pakistani	muslims	are	murdering	christians	and	hindus	for	blasphemy
yeap	leave	it	to	a	muslim	to	consider	stoning	women	to	death	as	funny
no	that	was	just	your	pedophile	prophet	making	excuses	to	slaughter	them	and	steal	their	land	and	property
i	know	that	your	husband	can	beat	you	there	and	there	is	nothing	you	can	do
rt	neo	nazis	and	holocaust	deniers	adore	because	he	thinks	just	like	them	more
bullshit	they	are	prisoners	in	their	homes	and	in	their	country
most	countries	are	moving	in	that	direction	but	not	muslim	ones
what	about	the	environmental	racism	experience	by	christians	jews	ezidis	hindus	etc	in	muslim	countries
your	pedophile	prophet	made	it	exceedingly	clear	what	his	intentions	were	for	jews	and	christians
muslims	want	to	be	able	to	abuse	other	while	at	the	same	time	pretending	to	be	victims
in	fact	mohammed	and	his	thugs	were	starving	before	they	captured	khybar	stole	the	jews	property	and	made	them	pay	to	live
no	the	murdering	hamaz	head	choppers	torture	children	in	dungeons
only	an	idiot	that	does	n't	history	would	say	that	you	have	never	studied	the	barbarity	of	the	muslims	during	that	entire	time
the	reason	that	there	are	still	muslims	and	not	jews	and	christians	is	due	to	muslim	brutality
rt	how	unsurprising	hatemongers	and	promote	holocaust	denier	h	t
free	them	to	do	what	cut	off	the	heads	of	gays	honor	killings	child	marriage	exterminate	jews	throw	ppl	off	buildings

racist	blacks	have	shot	two	police	officers	and	a	5	year	old	in
and	then	the	pedophile	sold	all	the	women	and	children	into	slavery	and	he	is	the	model	for	hamas	and	isis
because	the	muslims	have	been	exterminating	jews	for	1400	years	and	mohammed	started	he	muslim	hatred	of	jews
like	the	ottoman	empire	was	a	pure	slave	state
the	crimes	of	islam	far	outdistance	any	imagined	crimes	of	israel
and	we	would	all	be	worshiping	the	god	of	terrorism
there	is	n't	even	a	remote	comparison	between	abu	grahib	and	those	images	and	what	happens	in	those	images	represents	islam
another	line	of	horseshit	the	poor	muslims	being	attacked	but	virtually	all	their	attacks	were	offensive
no	the	muslims	worldwide	are	the	problem	israel	is	protecting	itself	against	the	same	muslim	persecution	that	is	global
again	you	are	an	idiot	the	muslims	were	thugs	they	quickly	figured	out	that	if	they	forced	everyone	to	convert	there
and	the	lying	muslims	claimed	that	all	of	their	attacks	were	only	done	because	they	were	preemptive
51	christians	or	hindus	have	been	murdered	for	blasphemy	by	muslim	mobs	in	pakistan	alone	why	should	israel	be	subject	to	that
mohammed	led	17	major	military	expedition	and	murdered	amp	raped	and	enslaved	tens	of	thousands	jesus	buddha	lao	tse	lead	none
in	every	christian	nation	you	can	say	what	you	want	about	christians	amp	jesus	muslims	kill	for	blasphemy
all	of	islam	is	blinded	by	hatred	the	religion	was	built	on	hatred	and	intimidation
somewhere	in	the	world	muslims	are	at	war	with	jews	christians	hindus	buddhists	taoists	atheists	and	anamists
not	only	them	mohammed	ejected	the	other	2	jewish	tribes	from	medina	and	later	slaughtered	them	at	khybar

and	if	you	are	going	to	follow	a	prophet	that	approved	of	collateral	damage	then	do	n't	complain	about	collateral	damage
in	fact	all	the	things	that	isis	does	are	the	things	that	the	prophet	mohammed	did	in	the	past

no	it	's	obvious	that	who	is	the	target	of	the	weapon	that	is	the	issue	killing	terrorists	with	any	kind	of	weapon	is	good
but	the	population	in	palestine	is	still	blowing	up	no	muslim	abuse	is	the	worst

who	cares	who	defined	it	the	muslims	lived	off	the	production	of	the	jews	and	left	them	impoverished
no	asshole	i	single	out	muslims	because	their	barbarity	is	set	in	stone	in	the	quran	and	they	have	not	and	can	not	evolve
today	christians	are	still	murdered	by	rampaging	muslim	mobs	in	pakistan	and	egypt

it	's	not	it	's	sex	slavery	is	permitted	in	many	muslim	countries	here	is	the	proof

yes	i	'm	hoping	we	can	get	the	muslims	to	stop	oppressing	jews	and	christians	and	hindus	and	buddhists
about	90	of	iraqi	civilians	are	killed	by	muslims
what	do	you	read	from	her	face	terrorist
if	you	do	n't	like	hate	then	you	will	have	to	rewrite	half	of	the	quran
that	is	a	lot	of	disinformation	for	example	there	were	never	more	than	5	million	north	american	indians
no	shithead	they	were	killed	or	forced	to	convert	mohammed	started	the	ball	rolling	by	beheading	600	jewish	prisoners
quoting	from	the	book	of	violent	fairy	tales	again
in	fact	many	muslim	countries	have	the	same	odious	laws	as	daesh	this	shows	sex	slaves	are	approved	in	ksa
do	you	think	that	he	is	jewish	any	other	way	than	by	birth
and	maybe	you	are	to	stupid	to	see	that	the	muslim	terrorist	in	palestine	murder	more	civilians	that	israel
so	they	blow	up	statues	and	churches	and	attack	civilians	because	it	's	all	they	can	do	as	they	die	in	their	rage
there	was	no	shujaiya	massacre	the	place	was	full	of	blumenthal	's	terrorist	friends	and	their	weapons
palestine	has	never	existed	as	a	country	before	the	jews	it	belonged	to	the	ottomans
the	arabian	peninsula	was	once	full	of	jews	and	christians	they	were	decimated	by	the	muslims	max	is	helping	them	finish	it
to	win	a	modern	war	you	have	to	have	educated	people	not	madrassa	rats
i	already	read	the	entire	quran	it	is	a	piece	of	filth	hatred	violence	sexism	and	bigotry
what	about	muslim	blasphemy	laws	they	lead	to	lynch	mob	murder	let	's	stick	to	important	stuff
in	what	way	is	blumenthal	jewish	other	than	by	birth	answer	the	question
the	muslim	societies	that	managed	to	survive	were	brutal	slave	societies	where	they	lived	off	the	labor	of	slaves	and	women

odeh	's	actions	in	the	us	proves	that	she	is	a	lying	criminal	and	so	undoubtedly	lied	about	what	happened	in	isr
every	minority	in	every	muslim	country	is	a	shrinking	minority	due	to	muslim	abuse
if	the	muslims	had	not	been	defeated	by	charles	martel	civilization	would	be	a	millenium	less	advanced
the	holocaust	happened	in	india	where	the	muslim	scum	murdered	80	million	hindus	and	in	africa	where	they	murdered	110	mil
jihad	is	the	cornerstone	it	is	a	declaration	of	war	on	all	humanity	and	it	can	only	stop	when	islam	is	completely	discarded

the	murdering	muslim	blasphemy	mobs	of	pakistan
a	muslim	woman	talks	about	sex	slaves	while	max	panders	to	them
and	this	proved	to	be	true	when	there	was	no	one	left	to	steal	from	in	the	saudi	area	they	became	broken	down	criminal	places
there	is	a	reason	that	there	are	over	100	islamic	terrorist	groups	and	why	no	other	religion	has	such	a	phenomena
it	is	an	obvious	fact	that	most	jews	lived	in	ghettoes	under	the	bigoted	muslims
i	think	daesh	are	rejected	because	they	are	an	embarrassment	but	they	follow	the	quran	and	sunnah	to	the	letter
the	difference	is	that	he	only	said	it	the	muslims	are	doing	it
well	idiot	i	see	that	every	native	minority	in	every	muslim	country	is	a	shrinking	minority	due	to	muslim	persecution

yes	isis	defames	islam	by	following	it	to	the	letter
and	the	problem	is	that	iran	is	an	extremist	theocratic	autocracy
mohammed	declared	a	jihad	against	all	non	believers	isis	is	executing	a	jihad	against	non	believers
most	likely	killed	by	muslims	and	i	'm	happy	to	see	the	israelis	get	back	a	small	fraction	of	the	land	the	muslims	stole

themselves	clearly	tell	you	that	their	intentions	are	a	bigoted	racist	holy	war	of	extermination
what	christian	who	is	not	insane	would	want	to	live	under	sharia	law
the	problem	with	the	middle	east	is	that	there	seem	to	be	no	good	guys	to	support	they	are	all	islamolunatics
your	friends	are	the	palestinians	who	cut	off	gays	heads	do	honor	killings	force	sharia
outside	the	israel	conflict	hamas	still	beheads	gays	does	honor	killings	throws	opponents	off	roofs
what	does	that	have	to	do	with	muslim	extermination	of	jews
then	you	are	a	total	idiot	because	muslims	are	killing	people	around	the	globe	they	are	at	war	with	every	religion	on	earth
here	is	a	hamas	palestinians	are	saudis	and	egyptians	conducting	religious	war
the	religion	of	islam	is	built	on	apartheid	and	ethnic	cleansing
no	it	's	anti	semitism	this	palestinian	leader	clearly	tells	you	that	it	is	a	religious	war	by
mohammed	was	a	sexist	who	abused	women	isis	are	all	sexists	and	abuse	women
and	off	course	the	fact	that	the	same	is	happening	to	minority	populations	all	over	the	me	goes	over	your	vacuous	head
they	did	n't	steal	anything	when	israel	was	attacked	by	muslim	armies	they	left	instead	of	staying	and	fighting
by	choosing	to	be	muslims	they	have	chosen	to	be	haters	of	non	muslims
when	they	left	the	israelis	to	be	slaughtered	they	lost	the	land	as	they	deserved
if	israel	had	given	palestinians	the	right	to	return	they	would	now	be	suffering	the	same	fate	of	all	minorities	under	islam
and	i	do	n't	care	if	the	jews	do	what	the	have	to	do	to	protect	themselves	from	the	genocidal	muslims
islam	is	a	believe	system	based	mainly	on	illusion	overlooking	gross	barbarity	is	necessary
it	ca	n't	be	separate	while	those	wishing	to	destroy	israel	use	it	as	a	basis	of	their	genocidal	fanaticism
hell	palestinian	muslim	assholes	like	this	clearly	state	their	intentions	of	religious	jihad	against	jews	and	you	tell	them	that
arabs	and	muslims	against	the	jews
her	very	actions	are	proof	that	she	is	a	liar	and	a	propagandist	because	if	she	did	to	hamas	what
what	race	is	islam	nut	case
wants	women	to	stay	in	their	houses	and	cover	themselves	isis	makes	sure	that	they	do
palestinians	do	n't	deserve	any	more	dignity	and	peace	than	they	are	willing	to	give	and	that	is	zero
1400	years	ago	my	ass	that	was	the	beginning	and	it	has	never	stopped	it	is	an	ingrained	part	of	islam
of	course	muslims	are	exterminating	christians	in	egypt	pakistan	turkey	etc	why	would	it	be	different	in	palistine
are	you	now	going	to	play	the	ignorant	argumentative	asshole	and	pretend	there	is	no	arabian	peninsula
here	are	the	verses	from	quran	and	hadith	proving	genocidal	aim	of	the	muslim	biggots
no	idiot	zionism	is	the	determination	of	jews	to	recover	a	small	fraction	of	the	land	stolen	from	them	by	muslims
muslim	terrorists	is	the	reason	why	the	christian	percentage	of	palestinians	has	fallen	to	almost	zero
after	chasing	them	all	out	of	medina	he	went	to	the	jewish	oasis	of	khybar	and	slaughtered	most	of	the	jews	there
mohammed	was	a	head	chopper	who	beheaded	600	jewish	men	in	one	day	both	isis	and	hamas	love	beheading	people
and	as	this	moron	palestinian	clearly	explains	most	of	them	are	now	egyptians	and	saudis	and	jordanians
mohammed	stated	clearly	in	the	hadith	that	he	wanted	muslims	to	breed	like	rats	so	he	could	take	over	the	world
yeap	as	a	little	propaganda	nazi	for	terrorists	you	will	reject	everything	that	disproves	your	lies	even	thought	the	numbers
she	does	to	the	idf	hamas	would	have	put	a	bullet	in	her	head	long	ago
well	baghdadi	is	also	into	slavery	killing	gays	executing	masses	of	ezidis	etc	they	are	both	bad	but	baghdadi	is	the	worst
probably	bcus	only	fools	amp	idiots	take	seriously	the	blame	someone	else	for	terrorism	industry	islam	is	to	blame
and	the	number	of	christians	in	israel	is	increasing	while	in	all	muslim	countries	it	is	shrinking
true	and	the	outcome	has	to	be	bad	when	either	group	of	islamolunatics	wins
and	the	muslims	want	to	destroy	israel	because	they	are	racists	not	because	of	the	land	which	is	tiny
mohammed	loved	robbing	caravans	and	looting	for	a	living	isis	robs	and	lots	for	a	living
what	race	are	muslims	poop	for	brains
hell	t	muslims	are	everywhere	chanting	death	to	everybody	jews	only	have	trouble	with	muslims	muslims	have	trouble	with	everyone
mohammed	was	a	pedophile	who	married	a	child	isis	marries	many	children
your	terminology	is	as	meaningless	as	the	assumptions	you	make	from	them	palestinians	have	no	country	and	never	have	had	one
actually	i	do	n't	think	it	is	possible	to	distinguish	between	islam	and	nazism
tell	it	to	the	120	million	africans	that	islam	murdered
the	quran	spells	out	global	domination	of	humanity	through	jihad	the	torah	has	no	such	global	aim
with	the	third	jewish	tribe	he	beheaded	all	the	men	after	they	surrendered	and	sold	all	the	women	and	children	into	slavery
but	islamolunatic	live	by	islam	and	sharia	trying	to	fulfill	mohammed	's	wish	to	exterminate	all	jews	from	peninsula
rt	hamas	sympathizer	pretends	israel	rejected	truce	to	end	blockade	when	hamas	admitted	hamas	rejected	it	http
those	same	genocidal	muslims	that	practice	their	bigotry	and	barbarity	against	religious	and	ethnic	minorities	everywhere
here	butthead	this	gives	a	good	summary	of	the	muslim	persecution	of	christians	in	palestine
maybe	you	should	teach	that	respect	to	the	muslim	hate	mobs	who	murder	christians	and	hindus	for	pretended	blaspemy
load	of	bs	their	numbers	fell	steadily	since	then	and	you	're	still	too	stupid	to	see	that	does	n't	change	ratios
and	while	all	other	religious	groups	globally	are	under	genocidal	attacks	by	muslims	you	blame	the	jews	utterly	stupid
terrorists	that	have	taken	the	church	over	she	was	born	an	american	and	so	was	never	subject	to
no	microbrain	i	'm	okay	with	israel	doing	what	they	have	to	do	to	stop	the	same	extermination	the	muslims	have	done	for	1400	yrs
any	idiot	would	know	that	the	expelling	of	palestinians	would	not	change	the	ratio	of	christians	to	muslims
i	saw	the	report	and	i	have	seen	other	reports	of	shia	crimes	but	i	have	not	yet	seen	evidence	of	it	for	tikrit
hard	to	get	stupider	than	you	still	no	change	in	ratios	justified	by	anything	israel	did
good	night	asshole	hope	you	get	run	over	by	a	bus
and	bibi	is	telling	europen	jews	to	move	to	israel	so	that	they	wo	n't	have	to	face	the	same	muslim	persecution	as	in	europe
i	pray	that	the	lying	criminal	bitch	goes	to	prison
and	the	israelis	are	fighting	no	one	except	the	muslim	terrorist
and	of	course	you	are	campaigning	for	the	destruction	of	the	israelis	because	you	are	a	racist	anti	semite	asshole
no	asshole	the	israelis	are	defending	themselves	against	this
again	idiot	none	of	that	changes	the	ratio	of	muslims	to	christians	in	palestine	only	muslim	bigotry	and	abuse	changes	it
what	they	tell	you	is	their	intention	is	not	their	intention.https://t.co/8cmfoozwxz
mohammed	was	a	genocidal	bigot	who	attacked	jews	and	christians	isis	and	hamas	do	exactly	the	same
no	more	so	than	the	muslims	who	consider	their	birthright	to	be	global	domination
the	prophet	mohammed	fired	the	starting	gun	for	the	extermination	of	jews	and	christians	from	peninsula
i	do	n't	see	any	burning	civilians	and	the	picture	is	not	even	of	a	burning	house
today	the	hamas	terrorists	still	call	khybar	khybar	to	the	jews	when	fighting	them
maybe	you	should	teach	that	respect	to	muslim	assholes	like	these
there	is	no	land	grabbing	40	of	the	arabian	peninsula	should	belong	to	the	jews	like	it	did	before	mohammed
the	voted	to	prevent	the	muslims	genocide	of	israel
mohammed	approved	in	the	quran	of	sex	slavery	isis	is	a	firm	believer	in	sex	slavery
why	not	your	doing	pr	for	a	bunch	of	palestinian	racist	nazi	head	choppers
but	no	muslims	stop	any	other	muslims	from	carrying	out	their	genocide	they	only	aid	and	applaud	them
the	prophet	mohammed	started	the	hate	fest	against	jews	by	driving	all	three	jewish	tribes	out	of	medina
one	thing	about	muslims	they	want	to	exterminate	everyone	who	is	not	a	muslim	they	are	doing	it	around	the	world
good	someone	in	the	me	has	finally	stood	up	to	the	muslim	terrorists	and	their	population	imperialism
the	abuse	that	christians	who	are	stuck	living	with	violent	muslims	endure
we	are	in	an	era	where	everyone	has	come	to	understand	what	the	real	is	all	about
the	muslim	palestinians	have	practically	exterminated	or	driven	off	all	the	christian	palestinians	bozo
not	a	real	expansion	just	already	existing	local	terrorists	declaring	loyalty	to	the	worst	of	the	worst
the	holocaust	was	by	nazis	and	the	people	who	fought	killed	and	stopped	them	where	christian	westerners
islam	is	a	strong	supporter	of	murdering	non	muslims	isis	is	a	strong	supporter	of	murdering	non	muslims
no	the	problem	of	the	palestinians	and	all	muslims	is	that	they	can	not	stand	for	a	jewish	state	to	exist	on	the	peninsula
sassy	more	like	femme	bots	than	killer	blondes

heading	into	2017	with	another	instant	restaurant	round
that	whole	show	is	starting	to	look	pretty	damn	good

this	season	's	is	going	to	finish	in	2028	at	this	stage
i	would	n't	want	to	deconstruct	my	lemon	tart
this	shit	show	has	more	comebacks	than	johnny	farnham	ok	back	to	the
i	do	n't	see	how	they	thought	it	was	so	hard	wanna	change	that	love
here	's	a	suggestion	let	's	make	manu	and	colin	the	main	judges	for	the	show
do	n't	get	this	dessert	lol
entree	worth	a	3	max	my	kids	cook	better	than	this	and	they	know	how	to	open	cans
thanks	for	making	an	unbearable	watch
oh	goody	another	surprise	twist	announcement	said	no	one	ever	in	the	history	of	watching	a	reality	tv	show	ever
can	understand	that	but	the	score	seems	so	wack
trapped	in	a	pole	dancing	venue	with	that	hotch	potch	and	sausage	impersonating	food
tonight	overload
british	lads	will	and	steve	are	taking	on	the	instant	restaurant	tonight	and	they	're	on	now
how	can	someone	fuck	up	cous	cous	for	fuck	sake	i	can	make	that	shit	with	my	eyes	closed
star	that	declared	bankruptcy	amp	hides	money	is	an	asshole	i.e.	christopher	skase	and	his	multimillionaire	sons	guilty
sassy	girls	rule
more	instant	restaurants	i	'm	so	fucking	sick	of	instant	restaurants
another	bloody	instant	restaurant	week	seriously	they	just	jumped	the	shark	riding	two	other	sharks	powered	by	shark	power
katie	amp	nikkie	are	pretty	gutsy
if	we	're	lucky
the	blonds	talk	about	themselves	too	much	they	need	to	work	harder	in	their	cooking
no	it	's	obvious	the	producers	want	some	volatile	action	between	the	women	for	ratings
i	bet	drasko	loves	a	bit	of	spatchcock
you	are	the	best
hot	pot	come	on	girls	about	as	technical	as	a	ham	and	cheese	toastie
yea	i	completely	agree	four	rounds	of	instant	restaurants	is	far	too	much	probably	wo	n't	tune	in	this	week	tbh
she	'll	turn	18	just	in	time	for	next	season	of	meaning	she	could	apply	for	mkr	father	dtr	duo
so	who	's	out	of
we	're	not	going	to	be	de	boning	this	spatchcock	the	other	teams	may	be	expecting	cooking	skills	but	naaahhh
they	ca	n't	be	judged	on	the	sorbet	it	was	n't	on	the	menu	yep	i	went	there	i	just	do	n't	want	lynn	and	tony	to	go	home
let	it	sink	in	that	it	's	now	march	and	we	're	still	doing	instant	restaurants	when	's	this	season	gon	na	finish	2016
is	there	anything	the	dreaded	draskco	does	n't	know
this	show	is	going	to	air	until	christmas	is	n't	it
rt	drasko	only	likes	his	mum	's	hot	pot	especially	when	she	's	drunk	and	unconscious
it	's	gon	na	a	girls	round	on	this	week	but	idc	bcuz	it	's	time	for	amp	l8r	amp
promo	girls	are	going	to	bring	it	in	the	next	round	yeah	bring	it	bring	your	store	bought	capsicums
more	farking	instant	restaurants	when	do	we	get	to	farking	kitchen	hq
and	remember	last	season	they	went	back	toward	the	end	and	everyone	had	to	have	2	choices	at	the	restaurants
that	's	where	dave	a	former	contestant	lives	now	hey	:p
how	can	you	get	a	7	for	a	dessert	advertised	as	lemon	tart	if	it	barely	even	has	any	lemon
omg	there	restaurant	looks	like	a	a	little	girls	room	oh	my	gosh
what	the	fuck	do	you	idiots	think	sass	is
katie	and	nikki
rt	that	's	not	sass	on	a	plate	it	still	starts	with	's	though	amp	i	find	things	like	that	in	my	yard
giving	the	loser	teams	enough	time	to	cook	everything	well	amp	beat	the	score	record	i	expect	scores	over	100
it	's	not	a	surprise	that	there	's	another	round	they	did	it	last	time	and	the	time	before
stick	to	your	day	jobs	girls
sorry	but	you	are	a	long	long	way	from	refined
we	are	losing	our	mum	and	dad	well	do	n't	cry	about	it	when	bruce	wayne	lost	his	parents	he	became	batman
current	highest	score	ever	on	is	helena	and	vicki	in	last	year	and	nick	and	rocco	in	2012	they	both	scored	95
i	will	not	be	using	killer	blondes	as	a	hash	tag
they	say	they	liked	the	mains	but	they	have	n't	eaten	anything	on	their	plates
trying	to	find	something	pretty	about	these	blonde	idiots.#mkr
soz	my	kitchen	rules	i	've	lost	interest	the	instants	restaurants	are	boring	as	anything	3	times	let	alone	4
i	hope	lloyd	and	drasko	find	each	other
i	just	want	to	see	people	who	can	cook	not	the	worst	of	the	worst	cook	badly	again
rt	so	i	guess	it	's	really	happened	the	competition	is	running	for	eternity
basically	the	twists	are	a	series	of	annoying	ways	to	extend	this	season
they	have	no	shame
rt	at	the	end	of	this	steve	is	going	to	run	away	to	mexico	and	go	into	witness	protection
rt	instant	restaurant	round	47

rt	are	you	upset	about	tonight	's	elimination	result
not	dumb	blondes	mmm	perhaps	just	delusions	of	adequacy
bloody	hell	another	round	of	instant	restaurants	stop	draining	it	channel	7
the	final	is	in	november
rt	after	that	knockout	round	this	is	how	many	teams	are	left	on	my	kitchen	rules
rt	colin	are	you	having	a	lend	7	for	main	and	dessert	little	skill	was	demonstrated	throughout

and	dazzling	white	lights	in	his	gob
rt	can	someone	smash	that	bottle	of	rose	amp	lime	cordial	over	drasko	's	head	please

that	was	definitely	rigged
how	the	fuck	did	they	manage	that
i	'm	thinking	there	is	another	round	of	instants	coming
a	7	for	that	dessert	colin	has	just	lost	all	credibility
those	sausages	look	unlikable	do	they	even	know	what	they	are	doing
rt	drasko	is	a	ridiculous	name	and	his	personality	follows	suit
did	they	drug	colin	's	serving	or
the	hunger	games
3	chef	wankers
rigged
yay	robert	and	lynzey	and	sheri	and	emilie	are	back
no	girls	you	really	really	ca	n't	win	this	competition
hey	colin	you	're	a	knob
lousy	scoring	colin	it	was	n't	a	mascapone	sorbet	dish	it	was	lemon	tart
can	they	please	not	say	sassy	anymore
rt	anything	deconstructed	should	be	banned	unless	it	's	a	shandy	amp	i	can	give	the	lemonade	to	my	niece
just	put	them	all	in	a	ring	give	them	some	boxing	gloves	and	watch	it	all	play	out	from	there
way	too	many	teams
people	do	n't	like	surprises	but	they	're	on	a	reality	show	irony
rt	there	's	so	much	sass	i	can't	even
do	n't	get	ahead	of	yourselves	you	've	only	proved	you	're	not	the	worst
not	happy	jan
my	cheeks	hurt	from	cringing	at	the	on
that	was	a	joke	bullshit	scores
rt	a	7	this	bloke	is	utterly	demented
katie	and	her	head	wiggle	reminds	me	of	quagmire
still	does	n't	change	the	fact	that	you	are	a	pair	of	airheads
one	of	the	girls	looks	a	bit	like	claire	danes
they	should	n't	keep	shitty	people	in	a	cooking	competition	for	ratings	how	about	you	focus	on	people	who	can	actually	cook
i	was	sure	they	'd	roll	lynn	out	like	violet	beauregarde
is	there	going	to	be	a	4th	group
can	someone	explain	to	me	how	food	is	sassy
you	've	known	them	a	fkn	week
kate	and	nikki	meet	sherie	and	emilie	class	elegance	and	humility
you	lost	me	i	ca	n't	stand	watching	those	conceited	idiots	any	more
surley	not	another	round	of	instant	restaurants
i	just	remembered	i	do	n't	really	like	many	of	them
you	've	got	big	hearts	colin	i	believe	what	you	're	meant	to	say	was	that	they	have	enlarged	clogged	hearts
oh	no	they	're	staying
a	7	this	bloke	is	utterly	demented
of	course	the	dipshits	stay
boy	sure	know	how	to	dish	out	an	insult	your	sausage	was	a	little	short	of	fat	glad	they	were	n't	male	contestants
sounds	awful	but	tony	reminds	me	of	mr	creosote	from	the	meaning	of	life
i	've	been	playing	the	sass	word	drinking	game	and	i	've	managed	to	deconstruct	myself
i	hate	deconstructed	deserts	you	never	even	get	anything	it	's	like	a	fucking	cheese	platter
of	course	they	're	going	to	stay	we	hate	them	therefore	they	're	a	ratings	winner
bullshit
7	for	the	main	amp	dessert	what	the
damn	this	means	j	have	to	see	more	of	their	faces
aha	but	no	one	else	does
de	constructed	is	code	word	for	fell	on	the	floor	right
three	is	a	low	score	good	work	sherlock
ok	so	i	might	be	turning	into	my	mother	but	is	n't	it	a	bit	rude	to	wear	your	hat	at	the	table
fuck	you	colin
they	better	have	spatched	their	own	cock
how	unfortunate	they	're	staying
and	a	7	for	smear	of	lemon	tart
i	hate	when	my	sausage	is	scored	a	3
your	hotpot	was	i	do	n't	know	gross
and	somehow	blonde	triumphs	again	bugger
wtf
preeetty	easy	to	spot	which	houses	are	producer	rentals
fuck
that	's	crap	lynn	and	tony	should	have	stayed
this	show	is	rigged
damn	he	liked	it
rt	we	have	hope	but	no	cooking	ability	well	that	's	a	winning	combo
welcome	to	our	instant	restaurant	tacky	i	mean	sassy
you	have	a	tail
rt	ya	gots	to	sass	it
officially	lost	any	respect	for	collin	that	i	had	left
colin	make	moine	a	dooble
have	you	two	even	thought	about	the	way	you	acted	through	this	round	scores	are	n't	surprising
if	they	cooked	like	they	would	in	africa	then	they	would've	been	in	i	'll	miss	them
joe	is	looking	hopeful
what	does	she	model	something	to	do	with	ducks
we	have	sass	oh	well	a	cooking	competition	is	just	the	ticket
out	come	the	fingers	and	toes	to	do	the	counting
that	's	bullshit	colin	and	you	know	it
after	the	3/10	i	'm	actually	hoping	that	lyn	and	tony	go	home
if	tony	amp	lynn	are	eliminated	they	should	just	burn	the	set	like	the	house	in	what	's	eating	gilbert	grape
rt	ad	break	pet	pic	not	my	tortoise	tho	i	had	them	as	a	kid	this	is	the	cutest	idea
u	think	they	realize	they	need	a	total	of	10	here
rt	if	tony	amp	lynn	are	eliminated	they	should	just	burn	the	set	like	the	house	in	what	's	eating	gilbert	grape
shoulda	named	the	restraunt
the	show	is	about	cooking	not	sass
makes	much	more	sense	when	you	realise	it	's	not	a	cooking	show
a	7	colin	dipping	his	end	in
apparently	sass	is	what	keeps	you	in	the	competition	rather	than	the	basic	skill	of	cooking
there	is	nothing	glamorous	about	that	restaurant
but	would	they	cook	better	than	these	terrible	contestants
just	eat	his	dick	already	drasko
this	is	just	ridiculous	another	7	ffs
it	must	wonderful	to	live	in	a	delusional	surreal	world	where	everything	evolves	around	you
handmade	gnocchi	for	dinner	frugii	for	dessert	my	home	made	dinner	is	better	than	that	dinner
a	7	for	unboned	spatchcock	and	instant	couscous
open	both	doors	please	wide	load	coming
colin	fully	channeling	edward	scissorhands	tonight
the	show	is	rigged	as	a	mf	the	afrikins	ai	n't	as	good	viewing
if	i	hear	the	word	sass	one	more	time	gt;.&gt
booooooo	ratings	win	aye
the	reason	why	katie	amp	nikki	cooked	the	main	was	all	in	the	name
pete	would	love	it
rt	the	moment	of	truth	did	the	girls	deliver	on	their	promises
love	how	u	have	to	where	the	same	stuff	on	a	different	night
the	sausage	was	a	real	letdown	hey
fuck	you	colin	that	was	total	shite
.@helloheliotrope	show	changes	its	name	to	your	kitchen	my	rules
the	bord
a	definitive	ruling	sherry	and	prawn	cocktails	are	not	competitive
saved	by	the	tail	of	a	spatchcock
my	guess	bottom	2	teams	from	each	round	are	going	back	into	instant	restaurants	just	saying
colin	is	fucking	high
just	been	challenged	to	make	this	menu	tomorrow	night	after	commenting	that	's	not	hard	i	could	do	better	than	that
someone	really	wants	to	keep	them	in
can	someone	explain	to	the	gals	sass	is	not	the	same	as	edible	food
collin	admits	that	he	is	easily	confused	by	a	sausage
ah	the	wages	of	being	awful
nooooooooooooo
colin	confused	get	out
pretty	good	dishes	we	're	happy	with	ok	well	i	'm	never	eating	at	your	place
katie	and	nikki	should	've	called	their	restaurant	conceited	not	sassy
her	leg	was	dry	bahahahahahahaha
rt	have	the	producers	lost	the	plot	or	have	my	eyes	failed	in	what	universe	are	they	even	remotely	hot	in
the	blonde	hate	is	rather	unbecoming
think	the	girls	will	easily	get	through
nikki	does	not	look	happy	with	the	group	's	score
oooh	what	do	you	think	is	the	surprise	announcement
rt	i	think	it	's	going	to	go	down	really	well	bahahahahahahahahahaha	wipes	tears
rt	i	really	think	you	owe	us	your	viewers	an	apology	this	is	a	cooking	show	right
you	have	a	face	like	a	dropped	pie	lol
rt	nobody	likes	a	dry	sausage
in	other	news	the	team	i	was	rooting	for	last	year	just	favourited	my	tweet	i	'm	not	crying	you	are
we	have	hope	but	no	cooking	ability	well	that	's	a	winning	combo
not	convinced	the	on	are	all	that	or	at	least	not	what	they	talk	themselves	up	to	be	here	's	the	test
and	the	next	surprise	announcement	the	losers	will	all	transition	to
hope	the	suprise	is	n't	eliminated	contestants	get	to	cook	off	for	a	chance	to	return
tony	and	lynn	would	n't	go	so	well	on	an	old	narrow	tv
meanwhile	the	week	one	contestants	have	married	divorced	bought	and	sold	houses
why	do	they	always	look	shocked	when	they	reveal	that	the	final	team	's	score	will	be	revealed	at	head	quarters	it	happens	every	year
rt	is	love	is	life
well	done	channel7	for	not	spoiling	the	big	surprise	announcement	this	week
i	want	colin	and	manu	to	just	feed	me
oh	the	south	africans	were	n't	happy	but	they	'll	be	gone	soon
rt	another	ad	seriously
maybe	there	will	be	yet	another	secret	round	where	colin	cooks	off	against	pete	amp	manu	amp	the	winner	is	declared	the	bigger	dickhead
i	think	someone	just	pressed	the	wrong	button
another	reality	tv	twist	please	stop	look	how	this	secret	round	turned	out
dying	for	the	night	when	the	special	announcement	involves	the	remaining	teams	eating	the	eliminated	contestants
oh	fuck	i	m	late	i	missed	stupid	shit	i	m	sure
to	be	fair	to	katie	amp	nikki	the	combined	group	score	is	way	too	low	compared	to	what	they	served	up
i	'd	push	for	a	4	i	'm	secretly	in	love	with	you	but	not	ready	to	come	out	i	agree
i	think	a	3	is	more	than	adequate	i	do	n't	want	the	sif	ifrikans	to	go	out
holy	crap	they	just	wasted	55mins	of	prep	time	getting	ready	and	still	look	the	same	i	hope	their	fall	is	spectacular
that	would	also	be	aces	on	a	turtle	in	water
another	surprise	twist	announcement	probably	going	to	make	everyone	do	another	home	cooking	round	because	no	one	can	cook
if	the	surprise	announcement	is	another	group	of	contestants	i	'm	done
no	matter	who	goes	home	everyone	is	a	winner	for	having	to	have	dinner	with	drasko	on	multiple	occasions
next	surprise	will	be	there	is	a	second	secret	round	taking	place	on	mars	by	the	guys	that	are	applying	to	go	die	on	mars
ad	break	pet	pic	not	my	tortoise	tho	i	had	them	as	a	kid	this	is	the	cutest	idea
i	got	it	they	're	bringing	the	slam	dunk	contest	to
another	ad	seriously
rt	katie	amp	nikki	from	are	on	tomorrow	we	want	to	find	some	more	sexy	butchers	know	any
omg	a	secret	location
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh	the	lip	prints	on	the	mirror	so	unhygienic	these	two	are	the	wooooooorst
raining	tens	more	like	raining	bullshit	because	we	all	know	no	one	can	bloody	cook
rt	if	the	surprise	announcement	is	another	group	of	contestants	i	'm	done
if	katie	and	nikki	scored	a	point	for	every	time	they	called	them	selves	pretty	they	would	score	around	273,345
rt	we	're	off	to	a	special	location	for	this	announcement	it	's	a	warehouse	with	drapes	and	a	stage	it	screams	special
oh	shut	your	gob	will	its	hardly	a	surprise
i	hope	colin	does	n't	like	it
have	a	feeling	the	girls	will	stay	just
was	that	just	the	girls	voices	on	they	add	confirming	that	they	did	n't	go	home	really	again	channel	7
katie	and	nikki	better	not	get	a	point	for	every	time	they	said	we	're	pretty
shock	horror
it	's	vs	serengeti	at	sunset	on
sass	will	not	keep	you	in	the	competition
runway	2	boxes	put	together	by	the	looks	of	it
so	if	7	needed	this	secret	round	cos	they	realised	no	one	from	the	first	2	could	actually	cook	will	there	be	a	double	secret	round
rt	bye	bye	birdies
oh	it	's	sas	that	keeps	them	in	the	competition	i	thought	it	was	cooking	silly	me
rt	drasco	's	doppelganger	would	be	a	more	interesting	conversationalist	at	a	dinner	party

double	elimination	or	a	challenge	elimination
rt	omg	double	elimination
hi	ho	back	to	the	dungeon	we	go
so	far	deconstruction	seems	to	also	be	happening	on	how	abt	constructing	something
or	maybe	the	surprise	twist	is	ash	beating	nikki	with	a	stiletto	i	'd	watch	that
their	restaurant	name	should	be	tacky	not	sassy
rt	i	want	the	blondes	to	meet	the	frizzy	loud	girl	in	the	other	group
i	'm	guessing	a	total	of	51	for	the	sassy	ones	and	the	south	africans	will	be	gonnnnne	as	they	should
rt	surprise	announcement	another	bloody	instant	restaurant	round
ok	who	should	stay	and	who	should	go

i	bet	the	blondes	stay	for	twitters	entertainment	we	all	know	they	failed	miserably
now	the	rest	of	them	can	eat	their	melted	sorbet
so	have	katie	and	nikki	done	enough	to	survive	what	do	you	think

i	'm	not	saying	tony	amp	lynn	are	definitely	eliminated	but	the	show	has	already	booked	a	fork	lift	to	take	them	home
you	confused	me	in	a	good	way	-is	a	that	a	compliment	colin	katie	and	nikki	think	so
was	the	reference	of	not	being	an	oil	painting	to	the	girls	or	the	dessert
wait	till	you	hear	your	scores	butcher	models
colin	ca	n't	taste	the	food	if	he	has	n't	got	his	eyes	closed

it	's	nikki	's	hot	pot	but	she	has	katie	make	the	sausages
emma	roberts
deconstructed	crap	on	a	plate
deconstructed	means	you	do	n't	have	the	skills	to	make	it	properly
they	will	make	it	because	they	add	drama	to	the	show
spatchcock	and	couscous	straight	out	of	a	cookbook
they	lost	me	at	pink	mason	jars	they	've	got	ta	go
colin	has	the	kid	gloves	on	tonight	they	must	be	the	producer	's	favourites	they	seem	to	like	the	dessert	what	about	the	micro	herbs
what	does	colin	and	the	rest	of	the	table	taste	and	see	that	we	do	n't	i	thought	murdered	their	instant	restaurant
i	can	confuse	you	in	an	even	better	way	colin
rt	surely	we	are	being	punked

gee	they	maybe	should	have	put	in	lemon	juice	in	the	curd	bye	bye	south	africans
is	there	an	anonymous
drasko	trying	to	use	his	fork	to	eat	the	breadcrumbs
turned	the	tele	off	how	did	tinyteeth	and	spindle	do	in

if	we	're	at	the	bottom	of	the	leaderboard	we	're	going	home	clever
it	's	not	even	pastry
rt	refined	amp	pretty	looks	like	something	a	blind	kindergarten	student	chucked	on	a	plate
surely	we	are	being	punked
to	be	fair	opening	a	packet	of	chips	confuses	colin	so	that	is	n't	much	of	an	achievement	really
i	actually	would	n't	mind	a	bit	of	strategic	voting	against	this	team
tonight	's	is	a	classic	example	of	ppl	trying	to	do	fancy	prep	without	considering	the	actual	eating	of	the	dish	fail	for	me
is	making	me	feel	all	stabby	right	now
if	my	daughter	had	a	yellow	smear	like	that	in	her	nappy	i	'd	be	rushing	her	to	the	doctor
i	think	lynn	and	tony	might	be	in	trouble	if	they	scrape	through	it	'll	be	because	they	are	nicer	than	the	blondes
nikki	kermit	the	frog	called	and	he	wants	his	voice	back
they	think	dessert	will	go	down	well	i	think	it	'll	come	up	just	as	well	but	more	violently
can	tomatoes	are	fine
can	these	girls	stop	talking	about	how	pretty	they	are	who	talks	like	that
rt	if	a	white	person	eats	a	dessert	and	no	one	is	around	to	instagram	it	did	it	even	happen
that	desert	is	a	travesty
why	is	colon	being	so	nice	why
call	me	crazy	but	i	like	my	food	constructed	i	would	n't	pay	for	a	build	it	yourself	dessert
solid	average
rt	from	what	i	can	see	there	's	a	large	gap	between	promo	girl	and	model
beans	on	toast	for	dinner	tonight	would	score	higher	than	tonight	's	menu	for	sure
those	kisses	on	the	mirror	look	like	cats	arses
stop	being	so	polite	what	the	fuck	is	that	shit	you	're	serving	us
too	funny	this	crumb	is	not	shortcrust	it	's	biscuit
these	girls	do	not	know	sass	but	they	do	seem	to	be	serving	a	healthy	dose	of	vanilla
her	laugh	is	horrendous
deconstructed	is	a	synonym	for	smears	of	mess	on	a	plate
rt	deconstruction	ruined	the	humanities	must	it	kill	food	too
rt	these	people	are	seriously	deluded	to	think	they	have	any	future	in	food	beyond	eating	it
would	make	my	night	if	the	two	on	failed	miserably	tonight	they	are	awful
the	only	thing	getting	butchered	is	their	modelling	careers
are	these	two	serious
will	reveals	he	once	done	some	modelling	as	well	as	being	a	body	double	in	a	porno
how	embarrassing	is	right	i	would	be	embarrassed	to	be	you	two	as	well
the	dessert	has	been	forgotten	about	already
i	think	i	just	got	turned	off	lemon	tarts
rt	trill	on	a	plate	with	smooth	stuff	perfect	for	budgies	with	beak	problems
how	on	earth	can	you	f	up	couscous	the	first	time	you	ca	n't	beat	the	method	of	double	liquid
it	's	refined	and	it	's	pretty	like	us	seriously	someone	get	these	girls	english	lessons	they	have	no	idea	what	they	're	saying
does	deconstructed	lemon	tart	mean	i	could	not	be	bothered	to	make	the	real	one
that	really	does	look	unappealing
my	dog	has	vomited	better	meals	than	that	mine	as	well	he	even	eats	his	own	shit	too
oh	dear	god	this	dining	room
i	do	n't	get	it	why	deconstruct	a	tart	that	's	just	weird

rt	in	what	world	would	you	not	be	disappointed	with	that
they	still	have	n't	churned	their	sorbet
but	that	's	the	thing	they	clearly	have	skills	but	waaaay	monstrous	egos	as	well
why	deconstruct	everything	how	about	learning	to	cook	simple	good	food	first	and	then	stick	with	that
go	girls
i	'm	amazed	that	could	actually	find	a	tweet	of	mine	acceptable	for	television	clearly	there	's	not	enough	swearing

rt	omg	do	you	even	plate

rt	lt;&lt;&lt;as	funny	as	a	fart	in	an	elevator	they	have	treated	this	lemon	tart	worse	than	brandis	did	triggs

hopefully	lynn	and	tony	will	survive	this	round	and	see	them	have	a	second	chance	the	girls	have	n't	shown	us	enough	skill
rt	the	deconstructed	lemon	tart	looks	pretty	much	like	what	your	plate	might	look	like	after	you	've	eaten	a	lemon	tart

rt	who	's	the	dude	wearing	a	hat	to	the	table	grandma	would	give	him	a	good	hit	for	being	so	rude
they	did	n't	roast	their	own	capsicum	disappointed
come	on	girls	u	can	win
rt	which	team	do	you	think	will	be	eliminated	tonight
really
who	's	gay
can	someone	tell	rob	to	take	his	hat	off	at	the	table	it	is	soo	rude
we	've	got	2016	wrapped	up	robaboon	and	zozo	strangers	that	have	never	met
no	juice	in	curd	unusual
rt	that	spatchcock	juice	that	they	put	in	the	couscous	looked	like	the	gelatinous	jelly	that	comes	in	a	spam	can	gross
i	adore	lemon	curd	butter	and	make	it	regularly	and	i	winced	as	i	watched
rt	miss	9	has	just	asked	why	did	n't	they	do	the	sorbet	first	to	ensure	that	it	's	frozen	in	time
i	still	refuse	to	believe	that	his	real	name	is	drasko
what	's	going	on	with	old	mate	's	hat
rt	deconstructing	things	needs	to	end
but	sorbet	is	dairy	free
selling	it	as	deconstructed	is	an	excuse	for	not	being	able	to	prepare	the	actual	dish
i	like	these	girls	we	're	totes	pretty	so	let	's	get	the	men	thinking	with	their	spatchcocks	but	how	oh
rt	remove	the	fucking	hat	at	the	table
rt	i	really	hope	katie	and	nikki	butcher	this	menu	vdl5vwxkrj
she	totally	just	got	that	juice	out	the	bin	did	n't	she	please	tell	me	it	was	n't	only	me	who	saw	that
rt	i	get	emotional	because	it	makes	for	good	ratings
you	got	ta	love	how	the	contestants	just	repeat	the	critiques	of	the	judges
this	is	even	better	than	the	can	opener
ooohhh	the	dessert	thought	you	were	talking	about	nikki	amp	katie	for	a	minute
drasko	amp	steve	should	be	the	david	and	margret	of	restaurant	reviews
another	fricking	instant	restaurant	round
talk	the	talk	but	ca	n't	walk	the	walk
just	what	needed	more	instant	restaurants
steve	looks	like	he	wants	to	jump	on	the	table	and	headbutt	drasko
at	this	rate	will	they	ever	make	it	to	kitchen	hq
contestant	living	indulgent	lifestyle	while	owing	creditors	over	$	200,000
slurp	#coffee
colin	scoring	for	the	ratings	tonight	a	7	for	a	roasted	bird	that	was	n't	stuffed	and	couscous	other	teams	must	feel	ripped	off
2016	the	winner	is	revealed	on
the	worst	menu	in	history
lemme	guess	the	blondies	stay	south	africans	go
another	instant	restaurant	round	why
she	's	put	the	arm	in	the	wrong	way
such	a	rigged	show	how	the	hell	did	katie	amp	nikki	make	it	through
sassy	looks	rubbish	i	would	not	eat	there
has	been	on	for	9	months	and	we	have	only	lost	3	teams
nikki	's	pouting	is	annoying	me	i	'm	ready	to	wipe	it	off	and	kick	her	off	the	show
cut	to	nikki	breaking	a	yolk	while	separating	eggs
drasko	drongo
rt	ca	n't	even	make	your	own	chicken	stock
just	catching	up	on	tonights	i	am	definitely	going	to	be	87yrs	old	by	the	time	this	show	ends
sassy	=	naff
kinda	sad	lynn	and	tony	left
how	can	you	refine	something	by	deconstructing	it
deconstructed	because	you	ca	n't	be	bothered	putting	it	together
rt	you	've	got	big	hearts	colin	i	believe	what	you	're	meant	to	say	was	that	they	have	enlarged	clogged	hearts
how	do	you	deconstruct	a	lemon	tart	it	's	custard	in	a	tart	shell
omg	how	many	instant	restaurant	rounds	are	we	gon	na	have	it	's	not	like	anyone	will	score	fairly	as	if	kat	will	do	that	grrr
follow	twi	insta
is	such	a	drag	my	gosh
refining	thru	deconstruction	right	blondes
i	really	really	hope	one	of	them	falls	down	the	stairs
how	gross	that	the	blondes	kissed	the	table	everywhere	hygiene	anyone
but	how	could	you	hold	2	jobs	amp	still	catch	up	with	every	night
that	main	looked	like	it	was	very	bland
yes	vicky	and	celine	would	be	in	for	that
so	it	's	good	to	see	this	season	of	mkr	is	now	going	to	go	for	17	months
rt	that	hotpot	looks	like	all	of	the	bristol	stool	chart	on	one	plate
lets	get	these	spatch	cocks	out
do	n't	think	i	'm	watching	a	4th	round	of	bad	chefs	was	looking	forward	to	next	challenge
i	know	right	just	shoot	them	all	get	it	out	of	the	way
they	need	at	least	a	48	to	stay	in	the	competition	can	katie	amp	nikki	survive	elimination
i	would	n't	eat	anything	those	girls	cooked	tonight	but	mention	spatchcock	to	drasko	and	he	's	all	smiles
the	quality	of	on	screen	tweets	on	tonight	is	pretty	equivalent	to	so	i	'll	go	with	that	policy	looks	undercooked
ok	the	way	she	handled	that	sorbet	maker	was	gross
so	never	used	the	ice	cream	maker	before
hey	is	dying	a	slow	death	even	looks	a	better	alternative
time	have	a	feeling	that	the	remote	may	go	through	the	tv	over	the	next	hour	with	these	two	clowns
rt	the	quality	of	on	screen	tweets	on	tonight	is	pretty	equivalent	to	so	i	'll	go	with	that	policy	looks	undercooked
food	handling	alone	they	failed	because	of	those	saliva	in	kissy	lippies	yuck
come	on	toowoomba	girls
leaving	lip	prints	all	over	the	table	nice	unsanitary	way	to	start	things	yuck	why	not	spit	on	the	plates	too
someone	should	just	serve	up	some	lines	and	a	chocolate	tube	wafer	for	dessert
really	so	is	going	around	again	for	another	round	this	series	wo	n't	be	ending	until	next	year	at	this	rate	too	much	of	a	good	thing
bloody	colin	maybe	he	should	go	to	spec	savers
if	you	have	to	keep	talking	about	how	hot	you	are	not	hot
channel	9	sticking	it	into	channel	7	over	the	contestant	who	plays	tennis	probably	in	cahoots	with	each	other	to	lift	ratings
was	nikki	amp	katie	not	present	at	their	instant	restaurant	where	is	their	confidence	coming	from
who	knew	that	was	how	to	do	it
this	technical	failure	must	make	their	stomachs	churn
can	someone	deconstruct	drasko	please	perhaps	another	serve	of	croatian	sausage	might	gag	him
and	that	's	just	the	girls
rt	note	in	a	spatchcock	dish	the	pomegranate	being	the	star	of	the	dish	is	not	a	good	thing
rt	sassy	looks	rubbish	i	would	not	eat	there
returns	in	2020	once	the	all	the	couples	intruders	gate	crashers	and	second	chancers	are	eliminated
nikki	you	laughing	sounds	like	a	dying	pig
okay	credit	where	it	's	due	well	done	girls	comeback	maybe
ok	enough	instant	restaurants	already
rt	deconstructed	lemon	tart	that	would	have	went	with	the	deconstructed	kebab	in	my	toilet	on	sunday	morning
seriously	two	couples	who	could	actually	cook	are	gone	while	two	others	clearly	should	not	even	be	on	the	show	reputations	in	ruins
not	sure	if	colin	or	snape
rt	you	're	all	hungry	to	move	on	in	the	competition	you	have	to	kill	and	eat	the	other	competitors	last	ones	standing	win
does	it	end	next	year
that	's	4	rounds	of	instant	restaurants	i	'm	done	you	've	screwed	up
the	number	of	rounds	is	actually	getting	ridiculous	now	stop	this	tv	show	loves	itself	way	too	much
will	be	offering	us	a	pension	seems	that	this	season	of	is	never	going	to	finish
oh	the	sass
they	're	both	as	awful	as	each	other	those	accents	are	clearly	fake
rt	i'm	sure	the	pot	that	it	was	cooked	in	was	hot	abarmezh86
lets	serve	colin	chev	up	sausages
breaking	eliminated	from	wait
i	hope	this	instant	restaurant	round	is	a	good	one	getting	a	bit	over	them
oh	great	another	fucking	instant	round	#mkr
wow	i	was	so	excited	to	finally	get	out	of	instant	restaurant	rounds	and	there	's	another	one	again	so	boring	big	stuff	up
i	hope	this	round	humbled	the	girls	they	ca	n't	cook
you	confused	me	in	a	good	way	really	colin	i	'm	not	confused	now	i	realise	you	're	a	bargain	bin	cookbook	chef
deconstructed	aka	a	mess
these	girls	on	mkr	are	giving	me	the	shits
what	a	crock	7	for	dessert	you	're	kidding	better	be	a	good	surprise
4	maybe	5	weeks	down	and	there	is	still	472	teams	left
a	4th	round	of	instant	restaurants	i	thought	3	was	enough	this	year	do	n't	get	me	wrong	i	love	this	show	but	seriously
argh	another	round	of	instant	restaurants	over	it
kat	is	horrid	horrid	diaf
sassy	but	sweet	ugh	that	the	question
why	is	so	white
rt	say	sass	one	more	time
i	wish	the	would	stop	saying	sass
pete	and	manu	like	it	stfu	kat	you	are	gross
even	if	kat	amp	andre	gave	them	the	3	they	wanted	they	still	would	be	there	and	the	blondies	still	woulda	gone	home
my	kitchen	rules	2015	episode	23	recap	eva	and	debra	serve	up	a	record
not	really	a	fan	of	but	would've	rather	they	stayed	than
deconstructed	a	lemon	curd	or	was	it	turd
thanks	for	once	again	letting	the	dramatic	ones	through	so	boring
omg	ca	n't	wait	to	see	kat	and	andre	royally	stuff	it	up	in	the	challenges	my	fingers	are	already	starting	to	twitch
what	i	have	taken	from	is	that	if	all	you	served	was	a	big	bowl	of	crackling	for	every	course	you	would	be	nailed	on	for	victory
is	going	to	kill	the	golden	goose	with	more	instant	restaurants	same	thing	happened	with	masterchef	restrict	supply	create	demand
well	i	was	under	the	illusion	that	this	show	was	about	cooking	turns	out	its	just	about	who	can	be	the	biggest	bitch
oh	lord
apparently	cooking	skills	have	nothing	to	do	with	succeeding	on	as	opposed	to	the	drama	you	can	provide	channel	7	to	boost	ratings
ffs	last	year	wa	had	chloe	amp	kelly	and	now	we	have	kat	amp	andre	channel	7	does	n't	like	perth	haha
who	would	have	thought	gracious	winners	not
that	is	a	fucking	joke
i	'm	so	glad	all	the	instant	restaurants	are	done	and	colin	is	back	was	getting	bored
so	i	see	channel	7	have	found	another	way	to	drag	out	for	an	extra	few	months	this	year
my	kitchen	rules
yep	same	but	it	's	also	wrong	of	to	let	them	get	away	with	it
rt	i	never	thought	i	would	want	katie	and	nikki	to	do	well	but	here	we	are
rt	poor	colin	not	looking	his	best
rt	i	love	it	when	these	judges	compromise	their	values	because	the	channel	7	script	writers	tell	them	to	no	credibility
okay	seriously	how	many	instant	restaurant	rounds	are	we	doing	this	year	this	is	ridic
no	consistency	in	the	scoring	woeful
colin	's	back
my	kitchen	rules	recap	eva	and	debra	become	the	highest	scoring	team	in	au
whoa	4	that	's	low	oh	well	lol
omfg	kat	i	will	cut	you	for	being	horrible	do	not
the	next	time	katie	and	nikki	cook	they	use	everything	from	tins	amp	packets	amp	their	dessert	is	a	block	of	chocolate	amp	a	tub	of	cream
rt	credit	to	kat	she	puts	a	hell	of	a	lot	more	effort	into	badmouthing	others	than	she	does	her	cooking

so	many	no	names	lined	up	i	thought	it	was	i	'm	a	celebrity	get	me	out	of	here	2
oh	balls	have	to	put	up	with	bloody	kat	still
do	n't	wish	ill	horrible	behaviour	disappointed	you	are	from	wa	all	the	way
kat	and	andre	are	bad	representatives	of	perth	non	wa	's	i	promise	most	people	in	perth	are	more	like	eva	amp	debra
psycho	eyes	you	are	a	truly	horrible	person
ca	n't	believe	how	nasty	are	embarrassed	they	're	representing	wa
the	season	finale	will	be	a	christmas	special
thought	i	saw	it
is	turning	into
bring	back	the	more	interesting	teams	thank	god
fucking	rigged	r	u	kidding	they	did	n't	even	make	a	mediocre	meal	there	was	no	sass	they	just	being	kept	for	ratings	i	'm	over	it
voting	strategically	on	is	one	of	the	lowest	things	you	can	do	you	're	sitting	bottom	of	the	redemption	round	clearly	not	going	to	win
rt	at	least	we	have	one	wa	team	we	can	be	proud	of	go	just	shhhh	sto
colin	u	r	kidding	you	are	so	lame	those	comments	were	so	made	up
strategy	is	over	now	nowhere	to	hide
kat	your	sour	face	is	repulsive
they	should	have	called	their	restaurant	crumbs'r'us
i	would	n't	order	anything	on	katie	and	nikki	's	menu	in	a	restaurant
i	can	not	believe	katie	amp	nikki	went	through	they	barely	cooked

wtf	is	manu	saying	ca	n't	understand	him
that	main	course	actually	looks	delicious	i	would	eat	everything	but	the	pork	cutlet
rt	it	looked	like	colin	just	turned	up	to	the	prom	without	a	date
view	here
wow	i	feel	so	sorry	for	colin	having	to	eat	what	those	2	are	serving
rt	methinks	the	producers	wo	n't	be	so	happy	about	this	bit	of	pete	evans	publicity
it	is	called	crackling	stop	being	pretentious	amp	calling	it	crackle
she	is	such	a	bee	eye	tea	see	h
ugh	kat	and	andre
if	i	hear	the	word	sass	one	more	time	i	m	gunna	blow
me	my	self	and	i
rt	this	is	fckd	fck	you	kat	and	andre
glad	i	can	get	back	to	my	life	now	the	fun	part	of	is	over	and	the	faux	masterchef	part	has	started
what	genius	thought	that	letting	teams	score	their	competition	was	a	good	idea	playing	really	dirty
maybe	if	kat	and	andre	spent	as	much	time	focusing	on	cooking	rather	than	strategy	they	'd	actually	do	well
one	woman	protest	can	not	stand	another	round	of	instant	restaurants	bye	bye
why	do	the	ugly	hearted	and	untalented	people	always	thrive	on	kat	and	andre	should	've	gone	home	such	bitter	assholes
really	wtf	sass	this	is	ment	to	be	a	cooking	comp	not	a	run	way	for	you	know	what	's	whatever
how	's	colin	and	these	rounds	working	for	you	pretty	crap	i	'd	say	from	the	tweets
rt	oh	god	you	just	scraped	through	they	did	n't	underestimate	you	that	much
could	n't	feel	more	different	about	the	2	wa	teams	proud	as	punch	of	eva	amp	debra	just	want	to	punch	kat	amp	andre	pair	of	fucktards
i	've	seen	vermin	more	lovable	than	kat	amp	andre
katie	and	nikki	may	have	been	too	into	themselves	but	kat	and	andre	are	far	too	into	crapping	on	everyone	else
at	least	the	blondes	always	scored	fairly	they	deserved	to	stay	tonight	to	keep	it	a	fair	competition	hope	kat&amp;andre	played	unfair
banter
why	is	all	the	excess	pastry	around	the	sides	of	the	pans
please	let	kat	amp	andre	get	the	boot	please!!#mkr
must	say	i	would	be	up	for	this	main
oops	typo	i	meant	one	big	bowl	of	shit
hope	the	girls	do	good	tonight

the	rosti	looks	like	one	massive	chip	that	has	been	in	the	fryer	too	long	it	wo	nt	be	good
bah	not	going	to	watch	my	kitchen	rules	anymore	lost	all	credibility	with	how	low	everyone	scored	katie	and	nikki	senseless	viewing

it	's	time	redemption	round	starts	now	wa
you	're	not	wrong	ca	n't	wait	for	their	comeuppance
i	'm	not	a	fan	of	chicken	liver

rt	when	manu	tries	to	steal	your	pork	crackling
jfc	kat	do	you	have	no	morals	carnt
my	kitchen	rules	2015	episode	22	recap	are	kat	and	andre	beyond	redemption
for	all	you	pissed	about	kat	getting	through	just	think	of	the	twitter	fun	we	are	going	to	have	at	her	expense	next	round
if	you	have	to	score	strategically	low	to	stay	in	the	comp	means	you	ca	n't	cook
kat	your	behaviour	is	appalling	and	embarrassing	soooo	glad	your	not	in	my	family	tsk	tsk

i	really	hope	these	girls	do	a	good	desert

after	a	spur	of	the	moment	roast	lamb	for	7	its	offical	i	should	apply	for
bitterness	is	a	dish	best	not	served	at	all	kat
use	ketchup
just	caught	up	on	i	think	it	's	safe	to	say	kat	and	andre	are	the	worst	i	actually	wanted	the	blondes	to	stay	amp	they	were	no	picnic
the	fact	that	everyone	is	hoping	katie	and	nikki	do	well	just	shows	how	much	australia	hates	kat	and	andre

kat	is	showing	her	true	colours
wow	i	really	do	n't	like	those	blondes	but	i	'd	like	to	see	kat	go	down	slowly	and	painfully
in	the	next	round	kat	will	cook	andre	just	to	get	to	the	next	round
kat	is	a	disgusting	failure	vampire	what	a	bloody	shambles	what	a	winner
some	people	do	n't	deserve	to	be	on
rt	kat	and	andre	are	behaving	in	such	a	spiteful	vindictive	manner	who	do	they	think	they	are	contestants
eh	it	really	just	comes	down	to	who	gets	the	most	favourable	editing	on	the	night	they	are	all	fairly	obnoxious
go	ladies	love	the	sound	of	the	crackling
tough	words	pete	from	someone	whose	paleo	cook	book	for	babies	was	just	pulled	due	to	the	possibility	of	under	nourished	babies
congratulations	kat	and	andre	you	came	second	last
kat	you	truly	are	a	bitch	and	the	lowest	form	of	a	human	being	the	only	saving	grace	is	that	the	other	teams	can	cook
i	think	we	all	know	kat	amp	andre	r	not	gon	na	go	far.kat	kinda	reminds	me	of	that	old	fart	from	last	year
i	've	never	hit	a	woman	before	but	kat	is	really	really	pushing	my	boundaries	ugly	fucking	mole
as	much	as	i	was	looking	forward	to	the	girls	getting	their	comeuppance	i	absolutely	hate	kat	amp	andre	bloody	ridiculous	scoring
can	not	believe	kat	and	andre	are	still	there	omfg	do	n't	even	deserve	to	be	there	lol	i	ca	n't	stand	them	soz	not	soz
not	even	the	roaches	amp	rodents	would	eat	kat	amp	andre	's	food
rt	kat	amp	andre	should	be	disqualified	as	they	're	giving	people	low	scores	on	purpose
i	was	hoping	someone	would	say	let	's	get	kat	out	we	'll	score	a	10
i	think	i	'd	rather	slightly	over	cooked	pork	chop	than	dishwater	fish	soup
rt	kat	and	andre	have	become	the	worst	ever	couple	on	in	my	eyes
i	did	n't	even	like	katie	and	nikki	but	oh	my	god	kat	and	andre	need	to	leave	right	now
wow	new	low	kat	and	andre
to	not	score	meals	on	their	merits	but	say	it	's	only	fair	you	stay	in	the	comp	is	a	joke	karma	will	come	soon
wa	r	the	biggest	bitches	ever
rt	a	1	you	are	real	arseholes
kat	and	andre	are	absolute	dickheads
love	all	these	people	having	a	go	at	kat	like	she	is	the	only	one	ever	to	vote	strategically	in	history	happens	every	year
so	disappointed	strategic	scoring	sucks
fuck	kat	and	andre	what	bloody	cheats
bugger	not	bye	bye	blondes
rt	why	why	why

rt	kat	and	andre	do	not	deserve	to	be	in	the	competition
i	really	want	to	fly	kick	kat	in	the	head
she	really	looks	like	the	kat	that	swallowed	the	canary
we	fought	so	hard	in	this	entire	comp	amp	it	would	n't	be	fair	so	you	battled	it	out	in	2	cooks	amp	the	girls	are	also	competing	how	so?#mkr
kat	and	andre	are	filthy	bastards

rt	whole	flathead
kat	you	snake	even	if	you	win	and	open	your	own	restaurant	who	's	going	to	go
kat	amp	andre	are	a	bunch	of	stupid	gutless	people
the	best	way	to	win	is	to	cook	well	said	by	far	an	excellent	reprimand	towards	and
i	hate	kat	and	fucking	andre	what	a	pair	of	mutty	unsportsmanlike	dogs
cat	needs	to	understand	that	she	is	a	terrible	cook	and	needs	to	strategically	vote	herself	out	of	the	competition
kat	and	andre	are	scum	i	am	going	to	get	such	joy	when	you	are	eliminated
or	hit	her	with	the	so	called	bread	she	made	that	'd	knock	her	out

kat	is	actually	neville	wrans	daughter	she	's	found	another	use	for	those	knives
kat	's	face	on	hearing	the	score
kat	and	andre	are	making	me	mad	wanna	kick	them	in	the	face	every	waking	minute	andre	is	a	fuckheads	name	kat-	you	are	a	feral	mole
rt	considering	kat	has	no	job	she	probably	has	heaps	of	time	to	read	all	our	awful	tweets

i	do	n't	know	if	i	'm	happy	or	not	on	one	hand	i	really	do	n't	like	the	promo	girls	on	the	other	well	we	're	all	thinking	it
kat	and	andre	do	n't	deserve	it	hope	they	destroy	them	in	the	group	rounds
voting	strategically	is	logical	if	coldblooded	it	's	a	fault	in	the	show	that	people	can	turn	to	it	drama	sells
this	round	manu	and	i	will	not	be	at	every	challenge	i	'm	fighting	a	negated	cook	book	deal	in	court

is	a	disgrace
i	feel	we	're	in	for	one	hell	of	a	ride	on	thanks	to	the	inclusion	of	crazy	kat
kicking	my	toe	is	better	than	kat	and	andre

kats	a	rat
kat	and	andre	suck	hope	they	get	eliminated	soon

live	in	areas	in	fans	concerned	re	not	in	evac	centres	email
i	think	only	judges	scores	until	the	end	when	contestants	just	rank	the	other	4	teams	4	for	best	3	for	2nd	etc	ca	n't	cheat	then
wait	i	thought	was	about	the	cooking	why	is	n't	anyone	talking	about	the	well	cooked	chicken	livers
kat	and	andre	are	like	the	worst	they	probably	do	n't	have	friends
as	we	said	in	my	country	fish	dies	for	the	mouth	see	ya	girls
ca	n't	decide	if	i	dislike	the	promo	girls	more	than	i	dislike	kat	amp	andre	either	way	one	of	them	is	gone	tonight	winning
how	to	make	brown	butter	ice	cream	with	yoyomax12
i	'm	out	people	going	to	to	drown	my	sorrows	in	roofied	fanta	night
rt	i	think	the	hashtag	got	some	traction
rt	good	news	is	kat	and	andre	are	n't	shown	in	the	promo	ads
katie	trusting	your	instincts	is	like	trusting	the	instincts	of	the	titanic	captain
katie	amp	vikki	have	requested	a	breville	sandwich	maker	to	be	added	to	the	kitchen	at	mkr	head	quarters
hope	katie&amp;nikki	make	it	just	2take	out	kat&amp;andre
rt	kat	missed	the	op	to	redeem	herself	in	the	kitchen	but	also	in	the	character	stakes
sorry	what	was	that	you	ca	n't	burn	anything	on	a	toastie
arrgh	my	hearties	we	get	to	see	captain	salty	farm	more	salt	thursday	and	her	trusty	gimp	i	mean	first	mate	do	nothing	at	all
scoring	is	ridiculous	liked	80	of	it	so	only	giving	a	4
thought	jane	was	safe	with	the	score	of	92	did	they	forget	or	i	missed	the	announcement
go	sassy	girls	made	that	apple	pie	kickass	:d
kat	and	andre	are	seriously	shit	people
to	stop	this	strategic	voting	perhaps	announce	all	the	scoring	for	each	group	of	instant	restaurants	when	they	go	to	kitchen	central
rt	how	does	kat	justify	her	statement	they	worked	so	hard	she	cant	cook	fucking	bread
aahhh	that	pork	looks	ssoooo	good
my	crap	tastes	better	than	the	shit	kat	amp	andre	served	up	i	would	n't	feed	it	to	a	dead	cat
my	prediction	next	season	there	will	again	be	2	judges	but	they	will	be	manu	and	colin
kat	and	andre	are	behaving	in	such	a	spiteful	vindictive	manner	who	do	they	think	they	are	contestants
i	can	barely	tolerate	kat	and	andre	katie	and	nikki	are	annoying	but	i	'd	rather	see	them	than	kat	and	andre
i	wish	annie	would	stand	up	and	punch	kat	in	the	face
strategic	voting	in	a	cooking	competition	will	only	get	you	so	far	when	you	are	an	oxygen	thief	that	can	not	cook
kat	gives	me	the	absolute	shits
rt	can	not	wait	for	kat	and	andre	to	crash	and	burn	in	the	challenges
i	want	sheri	amp	emilie	to	have	their	own	show	with	special	appearances	from	annie	amp	lloyd
rt	i	'll	say	it	if	no	one	else	will	that	kat	needs	serious	medication
it	's	for	toasting	sandwiches	not	cooking	potatoes	for	head	chefs
why	are	all	tonight	's	contestants	dressed	like	they	are	going	on	dancing	with	the	stars
sheri	amp	emilie	are	the	cutest	whilst	kat	amp	andre	are	the	most	vile
no	sauce	for	your	pork	lloyd	will	be	so	upset	he	loves	a	sauce	with	his	pork
tonight	's	result	proves	that	smug	arseholes	can	prosper
is	there	something	wrong	with	me	i	really	like	kat	and	andre	haha
haha	aaannndd	that	s	why	i	love	you
exciting	times	on	just	67	teams	left
kat	's	absolutely	delusional	if	she	thinks	it	was	strategic	scoring	that	put	them	on	the	bottom	of	the	leaderboard
got	ta	get	home	to	watch
kat	and	andre	are	horrible	people	who	do	not	deserve	to	still	be	in	this	competition
kat	's	face	the	only	thing	worse	than	her	cooking
i	've	been	sucked	into	the	trap	once	again	thinking	this	show	is	n't	rigged	when	it	obviously	is
at	least	katie	amp	vikki	can	cook	garlic	bonus
unbelievable	how	low	kat	amp	andre	will	go	despicable	couple	ca	n't	believe	how	disgusted	i	am	in	their	behavior
cooking	meals	for	good	thing	most	of	them	ca	n't	cook	for	shit	would	n't	want	to	make	the	airlines	food	good	for	once
crackling	people
it	's	totally	amazing	how	people	make	an	ass	of	themselves	on
rt	i	noticed	kat	and	andre	were	n't	in	any	of	those	upcoming	clips	hehehehehee
rt	purposely	pick	slightly	unattractive	girls	who	're	besotted	with	themselves	makes	good	television	lol
read	up	land	wubbers	oh	how	capt	salty	smokes	small	cuts	of	fish	for	five	minutes	in	her	new	cook	book	shit	cooking	ahead
worst	actually	wanted	to	throw	my	remote	at	my	tv	after	that	score	shitty	strategic	score	you	witch
i	find	it	fascinating	that	one	bad	critique	after	the	other	katie	amp	nikki	still	think	their	sh*t	do	n't	stink
ca	n't	wait	for	the	vic	girls	ash	amp	camilla	to	wreck	kat	's	ass	like	girrrrl	learn	manners	and	etiquette
hope	these	girls	do	good	really	do	n't	want	them	to	go	make	your	main	and	dessert	amazing	girls
rt	i	like	how	kat	and	andre	are	the	ones	trending
the	bimbos	make	an	awesomely	awesome	kick	ass	awesome	apple	awesome	pie	which	has	to	be	perfectly	awesome	or	they	'll	go	home	awesome
great	comeback	manu	cook	some	good	food	next	time	kat	and	andre
if	2	contestants	were	to	be	ousted	by	kat	amp	andre	's	unfair	score	nikki	amp	kate	were	the	right	ones	did	n't	cook	well	almost	as	bitchy
the	dessert	looked	great	i	would	n't	have	cooked	the	apples	like	that	but	i	want	to	try	that	icecream
i	do	n't	like	wishing	ppl	bad	luck	but	gosh	i	really	dislike	kat	and	andre	much	worse	than	tennis	man
i	preferred	the	activated	almonds	pete	evans	rather	than	this	new	dangerous	baby	diet	pete	evans
promo	looks	promising	pls	say	their	absence	means	the	r	the	1st	couple	eliminated	in	the	next	round	ugh
pathetic	channel	7
i	love	how	excited	kat	i	mean	she	ca	n't	cook	and	their	turning	up	the	heat	as	she	actually	has	to	cook	quality	food
rt	there	can	only	be	one	so	stop	trying	kat
looks	yummy	the	judges	make	it	stressful
please	lose	this	pete	evans	clown	he	is	dangerous
i	'm	soo	loving	the	show
i	hope	eva	and	debra	win	the	competition
happy	to	watch	my	last	episode	of	fucken	over	it
actually	hate	kat	and	andre
no	worries	pete	and	manu	take	all	the	time	off	you	need	in	fact	feel	free	to	fuck	right	off	i	prefer	colin
kat	the	rat
i	officially	hate	kat	and	andre	that	's	more	like	cheating	than	being	strategic	really	heartless	animals	they	are
next	to	be	eliminated	needs	to	be	kat	amp	andre	for	sure
so	i	just	basically	started	why	are	they	serving	chicken	livers	vomit
14	couples	remain	on	means	if	one	team	is	booted	out	every	week	and	two	in	semi	finals	then	show	will	finish	mid	may.
rt	at	least	katie	amp	vikki	can	cook	garlic	bonus
the	truth	behind	another	elimination	round	to	get	rid	of
what	's	with	all	the	it	's	not	what	we	were	expecting	judge	what	's	put	in	front	of	you	not	what	you	think	should	have	been	supplied
why	the	freakin	hell	do	katie	amp	vikki	puree	everything
ca	n't	believe	i	have	to	watch	more	of	these	two	flogs	kat	and	andre	on
i	hope	everything	goes	well	for	the	girls
this	is	both	season	2015	and	2016	next	they	'll	advertise	it	as	continuing	after	the	tennis
sorry	to	say	that	the	real	compitition	has	begun	katie	and	andre	but	do	you	have	the	gumption
looks	like	we	are	in	for	an	emotional	rollercoaster	going	to	be	great
i	have	a	few	favourites
you	can	eliminate	teams	by	strategically	voting	but	what	sort	of	person	does	that	make	you	a	chef	or	a	petty	person
rt	with	14	teams	on	our	screen	it	means	one	good	thing	less	kat	and	more	people	i	like
that	's	really	low
ok	get	this	off	my	fb	page	asap
kat	and	andre	are	such	revolting	human	beings
rigged
on	the	other	hand	you	can	argue	that	if	strategic	scoring	was	n't	invoked	katie	amp	nikki	still	fell	short	with	their	menu	to	stay
my	only	problem	is	there	are	worst	cooks	then	captain	salty
rt	fucking	kat	and	andre	eew
rt	but	you	all	respect	him"	pete	has	n't	read	twitter	has	he
they	clearly	are	n't	even	trying	to	hide	how	rigged	it	is	anymore	the	girls	should	have	stayed	but	kat	's	more	controversial.#mkr
is	closed	hooray	for	the	end	of	instant	restaurants	and	time	to	head	to	kitchen	hq	for	challenges	we	asked	for	change	and	got	it
rt	i	think	the	whole	country	hates	right	now
there	are	more	people	left	in	this	competition	than	probably	live	in	mount	isa
rt	kat	and	andre	fuck	up	you	're	both	oxygen	thiefs
kat	amp	andre	seem	to	have	some	very	strong	feelings	against	strategic	scoring	until	they	decide	to	engage	two	horrible	people
the	old	two	wheel	colin
who	are	all	these	people	i	've	forgotten
rt	oh	no	she	says	sticking	needles	in	her	eyes!!)#mkr
i	wonder	if	not	having	a	doorbell	disqualifies	you	from	applying	to	be	an	contestant
please	kick	off	that	lady	who	is	such	a	rude	person	she	has	such	a	crappy	attitude	towards	the	others	she	s	gave	a	one
i'm	so	mad
has	now	lost	credibility	boycott
rt	the	scoring	was	n't	even	done	honestly
kat	i	do	n't	like	anything	on	tonight	's	menu	well	go	back	to	hungry	jacks	then	or	eat	the	shit	u	served	up	the	other	night
what	the	foook	did	he	just	say
just	not	the	new	breed	of
kat	and	andre	get	to	stay	seriously	this	is	so	unfair	so	not	impressed	with	the	strategic	scoring	karma	will	be	a	b*tch
hoping	editing	might	be	to	blame	but	srsly	need	to	check	themselves	ca	n't	wait	till	they	're	out	cooked	by	the	other	teams
there	seems	to	be	2	ways	to	succeed	in	cook	terribly	whinge	excessively	about	not	getting	a	fair	go	and	give	1	's	or	u	know	cook	well
can	someone	get	that	homeless	irish	guy	a	jacket	that	fits
so	foghorn	the	english	geezers	the	blandos	amp	the	dead	beat	dad	gets	immunity	brilliant
our	favourite	teams	pushed	to	the	limit	so	kat	and	andre	will	have	to	cook	weetbix	and	milk	then
rt	kat	is	a	fucking	cunt
what	the	actual	fuck	are	they	saying	there	are	no	more	instant	restaurant	rounds	i	feel	ripped	off	there	were	only	23	rounds
can	not	wait	for	kat	and	andre	to	crash	and	burn	in	the	challenges
how	is	the	deadbeat	dad	tennis	coach	friend	of	the	judges	still	in	this	show
i	hope	their	cooking	shows	through	the	next	round	i	mean	they	have	to	plate	it	up	right	all	their	lacking	skills
i	noticed	kat	and	andre	were	n't	in	any	of	those	upcoming	clips	hehehehehee
ah	are	back
if	you	had	an	ounce	of	self	respect	you	'd	accept	that	you	have	room	to	improve	kat	and	andre	you	're	so	disappointing
and	here	are	the	tears	get	over	it	you	did	n't	do	a	good	job	stop	blaming	strategic	voting
i	hope	kat	and	andre	's	kitchen	burns	down	un	australian	their	tactics	they	ca	n't	be	happy	with	that
on	a	lighter	note	yay	no	more	instant	restaurants
miss	i	think	you	'd	get	on	very	well	with	seeing	you	both	loooooove
thank	god	now	the	real	show	can	start
we	're	about	to	turn	the	heat	right	up	with	another	instant	restaraunt	round	australia	turns	off	their	tv	's
with	14	teams	on	our	screen	it	means	one	good	thing	less	kat	and	more	people	i	like
kat	and	andre	are	fd
i	have	a	feeling	this	will	be	pete	's	last	season	and	colin	will	replace	him	goodbye	paleo	bullshit
what	how	along	are	they	dragging	this	show	on	for
really	ca	n't	stand	kat	amp	andre	terrible	cooks	but	good	whingers	amp	moaners
lloyds	happy	with	all	this	meat	on	tonight	's	menu
good	news	is	kat	and	andre	are	n't	shown	in	the	promo	ads
kat	and	andre	should	be	sent	home	for	cheating	twice	absolute	bullshit	they	should	not	see	the	scores	until	the	end	of	the	show
go	manu
everyone	has	immunity	this	week	kat	and	andre	are	sure	to	fail	big	time
i	think	we	can	all	agree	that	cooking	was	the	winner
pretty	much	how	i	'm	feeling	at	the	end	of	hope	that	mole	from	wa	goes	asap	surely	you	agree
all	of	that	is	on	tomorrow	wow	it	's	going	to	be	a	long	episode
kat	and	andre	did	n't	vote	fairly	they	do	n't	deserve	to	win
time	to	saddle	up
as	of	now	favorite	teams	on	would	have	to	be	eva	amp	debra	and	will	amp	steve	least	favorite	would	definitely	be	kat	and	andre
oh	really	no	more	instant	restaurants	that	's	shocking
logie	for	most	disgusting	person	on	tv	kat	so	much	joy	in	winning	by	playing	unfairly
rt	bless	i	totally	forgot	about	the	party	favourite	shaz
the	homeless	man	is	back
rt	ca	n't	believe	that	former	tennis	wannabe	is	still	on
where	's	gordon	f'ing	ramsay
rt	we	know	that	you	gave	it	everything	you	have	meaning	it	's	just	innate	lack	of	ability	that	cost	you
great	to	see	colin	just	got	out	of	bed	for	this	get	together
why	you	always	make	my	cry	why
rt	i	hope	kat	and	andre	's	kitchen	burns	down	un	australian	their	tactics	they	ca	n't	be	happy	with	that
well	too	say	i	'm	pissed	off	at	that	result	would	be	an	understatement	but	i	'm	confident	we	wo	n't	have	kandre	for	long	ca	n't	cook
notice	we	did	n't	see	kat	and	andre	in	any	of	those	cut	aways
i	enjoy	for	the	cooking	not	to	watch	feral	human	behaviour	kats	got	ta	go
the	good	news	is	i	did	not	see	one	screen	grab	in	future	grab	bag	of	eps
finally	the	good	part	of
for	topping	your	groups	you	can	now	invite	six	friends	each	to	join	the	competition
everyone	's	back	this	is	awesome	ca	n't	wait	to	see	what	they	are	going	to	do	this	year
nevermind	kat	and	andre	have	no	hope	against	the	other	teams	now
they	'll	be	back	in	the	never	say	die	never	say	never	again	round
not	a	big	fan	but	foul	play	from	kat	and	andre	wow	that	's	poor	form
can	not	believe	they	made	it	through	are	they	just	going	to	give	everyone	a	1	for	the	rest	of	the	comp
who	wrote	this	script
holy	crap	are	you	fucking	kidding	me	another	elimination	round	it	's	not	going	to	end	is	it	ever
why	do	n't	all	the	contestants	just	score	each	other	1	that	evens	the	field

do	n't	fuck	with	me	i	fucking	despise	kat	and	andre	fuck	off
do	n't	be	scared	of	colin	do	n't	forget	you	're	holding	the	knives
i	miss	robert	's	voice
i	am	so	sick	of	seeing	pork	crackling	on	time	to	do	something	different	people	actually	i	am	pretty	sick	of	mkr

completely	disgusted	with	kat	and	andre	's	scoring	really	disappointing
fast	snatch	is	back	surprise
oh	and	the	unhygienic	greaseball	returns
i	'm	glad	will	and	steve	are	back	though
will	steve	and	roberts	accent	always	get	to	me

not	watching	this	show	now	that	kat	and	andre	are	through	pathetic	people	with	no	dignity	whatsoever
kat	amp	andre	are	the	real	losers
colin	still	has	nt	washed	his	hair
rt	hope	they	get	booted	next	round
australian	women	's	weekly	reports	pete	evans	book	recalled	over	dangerous	paleo	recipe	for	babies
if	i	had	immunity	i	'd	cook	poo	sausage
did	they	even	have	chickens	back	in	caveman	times	pete
so	how	many	teams	are	we	starting	with	now
damn	you	kat	amp	andre	hope	karma	comes	around	and	bites	you	in	the	arse
jacquirudd	this	is	why	this	show	is	ridiculous	it	's	not	about	the	cooking	it	's	about	the	game	playing

our	judges	are	about	to	turn	the	heat	up	in	the	competition	what	do	you	think	is	in	store	for	our	remaining	teams
rt	wtf	i	not	a	huge	fans	of	the	promo	girls	but	they	never	voted	strategically	this	sucks	soo	annoyed
there	is	a	very	valid	case	to	be	made	that	strategic	scoring	by	multiple	teams	impacted	the	elimination	tonight
so	that	's	a	big	double	announcement	for	what	does	everyone	think

colin	is	back
i	feel	the	need	to	throw	something	at	the	tv	kat	does	n't	deserve	to	go	through
yay	jac	and	shaz	and	robert	and	lynzey	my	faves

everytime	someone	scores	strategically	i	come	closer	to	throwing	something	at	my	tv	it	is	cheating	omfg

i	really	hope	kat	and	andre	fail	in	the	most	spectacularly	and	humiliating	manner	possible	thoroughly	horrible	people
damn	have	to	put	up	with	more	of	kat	and	andre
nooooooooooooooooo
fucking	kat	and	andre	eew
i	do	n't	remember	half	of	these	ppl
double	elimination	its	only	fair	since	we	had	to	put	up	with	the	loser	round

kat	and	andre	why	are	you	cheering	you	are	now	the	worst	team	in	he	comp	#mkr

nikki	's	inflection	doing	my	head	in
this	show	is	so	unfair
on	the	plus	side	we	'll	get	to	see	kat	amp	andre	cook	another	delicious	meal	hahahaha

wait	for	the	wildcard	round
as	much	as	i	disliked	katie	and	nikki	they	deserved	to	stay	i	'm	quietly	hoping	a	rogue	frying	pan	knocks	kat	out	of	the	competition
kat	and	andre	wo	n't	survive	the	next	rounds	anyway
we	know	that	you	gave	it	everything	you	have	meaning	it	's	just	innate	lack	of	ability	that	cost	you
bullshit	strategic	scores	piss	me	off
pete	evans	looks	orange
if	had	any	integrity	they	would	disqualify	kat	and	andre	for	strategic	scoring
what	in	the	actual	fuck
colin	gave	me	feelings	as	he	walked	out	then	not	sure	if	good	or	bad
and	the	producers	rejoice	more	twitter	rage	for	kat	hooray	ratings
seriously	i	would	fucking	picket	kat	and	andre	's	restaurant	outrageous	behaviour

do	n't	understand	how	bad	sportsmanship	can	be	condoned	by
this	is	fckd	fck	you	kat	and	andre
this	is	why	this	show	is	ridiculous	it	's	not	about	the	cooking	it	's	about	the	game	playing

how	hard	is	it	to	be	humble
i	thought	they	were	going	to	make	the	top	teams	go	through	another	instant	restaurant	round
ol'	crazy	eyes	lives	to	massacre	another	menu
i	am	loving	so	much	to	hate
bad	sportsmanship	by	kat	un	australian
a	1	is	n't	strategy	it	's	bastedry
scoring	a	1	just	shows	you	're	a	douche
i	'm	absolutely	disgusted	kat	and	andre	do	n't	deserve	to	stay	in	this	competition	they	did	nt	vote	strategically	they	flat	out	cheated
kat	amp	andre	aka	worst	humans	to	ever	inhabit	this	earth
i	am	physically	sickened	i	think	i	'm	officially	done	with	this	show	for	the	year	seeya
the	scoring	was	n't	even	done	honestly

rt	evil	triumphed	over	a	slightly	lesser	evil	i	guess	that	is	some	sort	of	moral	of	some	description
safe	one	day	but	it	's	not	how	long	you	may	go	but	how	far	does	your	knife	throw

i	did	n't	really	love	katie	and	nikki	to	begin	with	but	i	really	preferred	them	over	kat	and	andre	and	how	shitty	they	are
ass	cream
if	only	both	those	bottom	teams	could	be	eliminated
it	was	the	2	points	kat	took	off	to	be	strategic
noooooo	whyyyyy
lol	an	8	from	pete	is	definitely	strategic	strategic	to	increase	tv	ratings
bullshit	i	do	n't	know	how	many	more	episodes	with	kat	and	andre	i	could	stand
nooooo
rt	pete	evans	make	your	own	baby	formula	may	be	fatal	for	babies
no	no	no	no	no	no
even	if	i	did	nt	like	their	food	i	d	score	them	an	8	just	because	i	hate	kat	and	andre
i	cry	foul	boooooooo
i	am	eternally	angry
that	's	unfair	and	fucked	up
oh	no	no	no	it	's	a	conspiracy

with	so	many	rounds	going	on	i	ca	n't	who	are	some	of	these	contestants
kat	is	better	tv	she	is	a	natural	villian	unlike	ash	who	is	a	fake	one
ripped	off	poor	girls	that	's	ridiculous
bull
can	they	just	send	kat	and	andre	home	anyway	because	they	're	rude	and	annoying	and	score	everyone	strategically
dammit	kat	and	andre	are	safe	not	happy
they	need	a	couple	of	8	's
proof	there	is	no	god	kat	survives
bad	news	kat	and	andre	are	in	good	news	no	more	horrendous	voting	from	teams
goodbye	katie	and	nikki
kat	and	andre	are	the	sort	of	people	who	would	look	forward	to	funerals	knowing	they	will	be	getting	a	free	feed	afterwards

unfair	scoring	by	kat	amp	andre	c*nts
rt	it	would	n't	be	fair	cause	voting	strategically	is	fair	right	kat
rt	i	blame	the	other	teams	for	this
sorry	but	even	if	you	did	make	it	through	there	was	no	way	you	would	have	made	it	to	the	end
ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
what	bullshit	kat	amp	andre	rejoicing	because	they	got	through	but	they	scored	a	1	that	's	the	equivalent	of	cheating
kat	and	andre	are	the	worst
its	not	close	at	all
kat	and	andre	celebrating	bad	cooking	bad	attitude	and	strategic	scoring	absolute	champs
if	tonight	proves	nothing	else	instant	restaurants	should	be	judges	scoring	only	pathetic	from	kat	and	andre
strategic	scoring	is	wrong	secret	ballot	is	the	way	to	go	reveal	totals	at	the	end
there	's	still	a	few	teams	that	need	to	be	voted	off	the	island
well	i	called	it
livers	needed	fava	beans	and	a	nice	chianti
but	i	do	n't	ever	want	to	see	or	hear	kat	again	ever
cya	katie	and	nikki
tacky	vs	wacky	not	sure	who	i	'd	like	to	stay	in	the	competition

robert	is	back
it	would	nt	be	fair	if	u	stay	u	cooked	shit
ok	well	the	score	was	able	to	be	manipulated	by	the	contestants	to	let	the	inferior	team	through	does	n't	sound	fair	really
is	there	enough	blue	in	the	wardrobe	department
i	hope	kat	and	andre	see	themselves	on	tv	and	are	utterly	ashamed	of	themselves
kat	and	andre	you	need	to	go
kitchen	hq	is	a	warehouse	in	coburg
especially	formulated	by	ugg

what	s	a	roshti
fml
bullshit
kat	's	gloating	is	nauseating
katie&amp;nikki	over	andre&amp;katt	any	day	go
that	's	the	spirit
do	you	think	kat	is	happy	with	that	group	score
with	spinich	who	does	n't	love	spinich
stop	smiling	kat
a	17	i	smell	a	fine	cotten	scandal
i	've	never	eaten	chicken	liver
is	so	intense	this	round
i	predict	a	1	point	difference	in	score	just	saying
katie	and	nikki	pissed	me	off	at	the	start	but	kat	and	andre	are	the	worst	team	on	mkr
i	will	have	to	switch	off	if	kat	and	andre	make	it	through	i	wo	n't	be	able	to	handle	the	tsunami	of	smugness
i	dont	know	how	i	feel	this	way	but	i	wo	n't	the	bloody	blondes	to	stay	thats	just	how	horrid	kat	is
17	that	s	insane

shit	is	that	dire	i	want	the	promo	girls	to	get	thru	at	least	they	have	n't	been	as	obnoxious	this	time	around
lets	see	who	the	producers	think	are	going	to	be	better	tv	kat	or	nikki	and	katie
everyone	is	scoring	strategically	get	rid	of	the	ones	that	can	cook	and	keep	in	kat	amp	andre	that	ca	n't	cook
i	am	furious
if	kat	and	andre	stay	tonight	i	will	stop	watching	my	kitchen	rules
kat	is	defining	fair
twist	in	the	plot	the	bottom	2	teams	leave	i	think	everyone	would	be	happy

what	's	irene	doing	on
always	needs	an	evil	team	for	ratings	kat	amp	andrew	are	that	evil	team	they	will	intentionally	survive
i	hope	do	n't	get	kicked	off
strategic"scoring	should	be	classed	as	cheating	everyone	scored	kat	and	andre	fairly	and	accordingly	why	ca	n't	they	do	the	same
well	shit
feeling	quite	sorry	for	the	nsw	promo	bitches
wtf	score	did	you	expect	serving	liver
by	fought	hard	kat	means	voted	strategically
teams	deserve	an	oscar	for	their	performance	tonight	in	holy	shit	this	is	a	terrible	meal	but	i	'll	pretend	to	love	it

insert	evil	laugh	here
kat	in	shock	and	humiliated	so	enjoyable
and	you	thought	annie	and	lloyds	was	bad
how	many	times	does	karma	have	to	slap	you	in	the	face	till	you	realise	you	ca	n't	cook	kat	and	andre
kat	and	andre	are	so	so	mean
rt	the	ever	charming	kat	has	a	moment	of	humour
those	poor	contestants	having	to	camp	amp	cook	for	200	for	breakfast	camping	putting	up	a	tent	not	staying	in	a	cabin	camping	yuck

wow	kat	amp	annie	make	the	perfect	horrible	couple

colin	does	n't	care	if	you	're	cooking	on	the	lake	marine	parks	and	wildlife	do
that	's	karma	kat	and	andre
everything	sounds	like	a	dish	you	want	to	eat	pete	because	you	do	n't	eat	fkn	food
i	'm	with	that	kid
kat	and	andre	you	are	as	unpleasant	as	your	cooking

lol	kat	's	smile	gone	in	less	than	5	seconds
colin	's	review	of	kat	amp	andre	is	equivalent	of	a	teacher	saying	well	done	on	writing	your	name	in	pencil
rt	where	's	manu	did	i	miss	something	at	the	beginning	of	the	show
go	colin	he	's	actually	showing	a	sense	of	humour	all	you	need	is	some	personal	grooming	and	i	might	like	you

rose	and	josh	are	one	of	my	favourite	teams	on
kat	vs	annie	in	sudden	death	please
normally	when	kat	amp	andre	go	to	campgrounds	it	's	so	they	can	enjoy	some	dogging
this	challenge	is	really	separating	the	good	cooks	from	the	bad
colin	+	pete	=	too	much	unlikeableness	and	orange	this	season	of	is	leaving	a	bitter	taste	in	my	mouth	already
i	hope	sheri	and	emilie	do	n't	go	to	sudden	elimination	please	no	:3

pete	does	n't	like	kat	and	andres	dish	hopefully	that	means	they	're	on	sudden	death
blech	on	the	raw	eggs	should	have	just	left	it	to	cook	longer
rt	it	's	a	dish	that	could	appeal	to	the	public	the	moronic	ignorant	public	that	do	n't	eat	a	paleo	diet	pete
lots	of	raw	food	around

i	think	colin	might	not	be	a	fan	of	the	meatballs
you	do	n't	suck	sheri	and	emilie
it	's	a	crime	against	cooking	the	shade
i	feel	like	making	pancakes
i	love	little	kid	foodies
great	to	see	the	local	national	park	workers	tucking	into	a	free	feed	how	about	you	empty	those	loo	's	instead
was	n't	watching	the	screen	and	briefly	thought	colin	was	manu	doing	a	bad	aussie	accent
i	'm	sure	opening	the	bbq	to	let	all	the	hot	air	out	will	make	it	cook	faster
bottom	2	teams	i	'm	thinking	kat	and	andre	and	annie	and	lloyd
i	ca	n't	believe	people	are	still	surprised	that	annie	and	lloyd	ca	n't	cook
camilla	is	back	show	us	ya	norks
how	do	you	screw	up	cooking	bread	in	a	cooking	competition
i	do	n't	think	those	meatballs	would	do	any	better	in	a	library	or	in	disneyland	or	any	place	really
annie	is	giving	rob	a	run	for	his	money	in	the	silly	hat	competition
can	kat	and	andre	go	already
there	's	a	police	boat	over	there	this	is	a	crime	against	cooking	ok	i	fully	approve	now	of	colin	being	a	judge
all	the	food	looks	delicious	i	want	to	be	a	camper	now
really	annie	a	pony	how	can	it	fit	in	there
i	reckon	rob	and	dave	could	serve	shit	on	a	stick	and	those	scabs	i	mean	campers	would	eat	anything
baked	beans	tin	on	the	weber	and	jaffles	in	the	fire	should	've	gone	on
7	minute	add	breaks	bloody	cheeky
those	meatballs	are	so	wrong	definitely	not	a	breakfast	meal
fkn	hell	you	just	had	to	go	and	say	it	another	3	times
go	rob	and	dave	do	it	for	the	boys
raw	egg	sorry	but	you	are	n't	serving	breakfast	to	rocky
pancakes	a	winner	with	the	kids
so	no	beans	on	toast	assholes	call	that	camping	breakfast
victorian	teams	are	doing	well	naturally
when	you	're	cooking	for	the	public	a	safe	option	is	a	good	option	you	want	more	people	eating	voting
looks	delish	love	jane	and	emma	's	hotcake	dish	it	looks	to	good	to	eat	through	the	television
did	that	nandos	advert	really	just	happen
of	course	the	salmons	fucking	popular	does	that	crowd	look	like	the	type	of	people	who	would	actually	buy	salmon
amp	are	the	strongest	contenders	so	far	will	the	campers	agree	with	the	judges
they	're	immune	for	being	top	scorers	in	their	round	i	think	4	teams	are	so	not	cooking	this	time
the	mother	and	son	team	are	sooooo	nice

rt	every	day	i	find	it	harder	and	harder	to	tell	you	and	apart
i	'm	glad	california	is	finally	getting	some	rain	but	i	really	wish	it	was	n't	happening	while	i	was	driving
after	the	5th	time	hydroplaning	while	going	10	under	the	speed	limit	calling	it	for	the	night	was	hoping	to	make	it	to	cali	40	m	away
my	personal	facebook	is	not	ever	a	place	to	debate	that	i	'll	unblock	but	please	do	n't	do	that	again
the	ethics	policy	for	gamergate	does	n't	exist
need	github	but	ty	anyways

gater_ebooks	is	very	fond	of	patreons
i	had	a	bunch	of	commands	to	help	manage	ggautoblocker	related	stuff	also	started	fights	between	randi	gater_ebooks
no	worries	i	block	quickly	from	my	facebook	the	notifications	go	to	my	phone	unlike	twitter	but	always	willing	to	unblock
consume_all	vs	consume	all	does	n't	mention	model	name	must	be	first
yeah	i	made	a	bunch	of	changes	with	the	old	ver	nice	to	see	some	of	them	are	n't	needed	anymore
easier	with	github	i	do	n't	have	time	to	spend	on	being	an	admin
er	like	i	would	expect
really	tho	i	kind	of	just	want	to	drain	a	glass	of	wine	and	rant	about	things	that	i	do	n't	like	but	i	can	do	that	anytime
rt	i	think	we	should	have	a	public	debate	with	and	a	woman	in	tech	topic	why	should	speak	for	women
i	really	wish	i	had	the	time	to	dig	more	into	su	financials	and	such	seems	basically	cxo	circlejerk
whelp	i	'm	starting	to	get	a	pretty	decent	platform	i	'm	going	to	get	his	face	out	there	alright	lt;3
if	he	really	wanted	to	ally	he	'd	get	his	dudebros	to	change	not	tell	women	how	to	fit	in	with	dudebros

i	am	probably	not	answering	email	tonight	i	have	other	work	to	catch	up	on	this	weekend	=	=	gobs	of	email
rt	your	bot	certainly	fooled	me	i	must	admit	i	was	spanked	this	time
rt	this	is	why	the	media	needs	to
it	is	just	short	of	paying	my	rent	after	all	fees	so	i	ca	n't	complain	though	it	's	doing	better	than	i	thought	it	would
bahahaha
it	goes	both	ways	this	is	from	a	very	limited	sample	size	people	are	far	less	likely	to	harass	on	fb	w	real	names
if	you	're	waiting	on	a	response	and	approximately	120	people	are	i	am	sorry	i	was	afk	for	a	week	i	will	respond	soon
i	thought	it	was	looking	at	tweet	ids	or	dates	i	'm	pulling	from	multiple	user	accounts
no	that	's
rt	dear	your	darpa	sponsored	body	double	is	now	available	for	pickup	they	'll	never	know	the	diff
i	had	to	source	many	gater	's	timelines	the	grammar	was	n't	good	enough	for	it	to	work	well	with	just	one	seriously
cc
they	restart	daily	to	pull	in	new	tweets
rt	it	really	feels	like	the	dm	can	be	the	hand	on	the	knee	of	social	communication
yeah	the	name	of	the	game	lately	is	staying	one	step	ahead	of	gater	's	attempts	to	shut	things	down	abuse	the	system
rt	well	this	is	a	pretty	disgusting	way	to	spin	things	gamergate
first	i	noticed	the	misogyny	but	then	i	realized	plz	brush	your	teeth
rt	that	shit	tattoo	that	shit	on	your	forehead	that	message	is	important*.
the	anti	abuse	thing	is	my	main	focus	always	but	in	my	spare	time	his	bullshit	is	abusive	towards	feminism
generally	anytime	you	say	devil	's	advocate	it	means	you	're	wasting	people	's	time	and	being	an	ass	especially	arguing	points
yo	ladies	i	think	it	's	time	we	sit	down	as	a	group	and	talk	about	google	hangouts	broadcasted
sweet	i	use	an	iphone	because	i	am	not	a	peasant
sorry	need	to	stick	to	github
but	i	've	only	discussed	with	other	members	of	targeted	harassment	from	this	specific	group	ca	n't	speak	for	other	hate	groups
he	did	n't	worry	about	me	back	then	since	then	i	've	been	published	everywhere	he	's	trying	to	discredit

er	into	a	single	model	i	mean	from	multiple	corpuses	or	whatever

grafana	is	weird	i	've	never	used	it	before	it	does	not	act	like	it	would	expect
oh	i	just	saw	the	latest	version	has	consume	all	but	help	docs	are	bugged	btw
grafana

sticking	to	github	for	now	i	need	to	stick	with	orgs	where	i	know	i	've	got	internal	contacts	for	abuse	related	things
i	want	to	see	this	but	storify	is	returning	error	code	500
hehe	i	'm	used	to	copying	a	status	url	and	pasting	a	lot	:p	love	all	of	the	responses	i	get	though	ty	for	the	idea
jfc
rt	got	ta	love	that	we	determine	the	good	feminists	and	it	's	men	mentality	that	gg	has	zero	self	awareness
it	amazes	me	how	he	thinks	he	's	helping	feminism	by	telling	women	they	are	doing	it	wrong	what
will	read	got	ta	go	afk	for	a	bit	still	bringing	stuff	in	from	car	after	week	long	road	trip
they	are	both	pretty	entertaining	to	talk	to	sometimes
i	want	more	than	5	private	repos	in	github	gdi
that	person	sounds	like	a	moron	i	like	to	find	people	like	that	and	shit	on	them
npo	can	take	a	year
also	i	'm	thinking	that	another	sjw	party	may	be	happening	soon	perhaps	after	gdc
see	replies
i	need	to	just	switch	to	an	organization	based	github	but	i	do	n't	want	to	pay	$	25/month	because	i	'm	cheap
it	ends	after	a	day	at	the	most	but	will	be	stopping	soon	since	i	'm	shutting	them	down	for	maint
not	my	field	^.^	at	a	guess	you	can	be	just	as	tied	to	a	pseudonym	as	your	real	name	or	even	more	so
i	'd	have	to	have	a	space	for	it	and	chances	are	by	now	most	people	already	have	their	schedules	booked
doin'	stuff
i	have	been	raging	at	him	for	uh	5	months	i	think	ever	since	innovating	women
this	clip	is	11	minutes	listen	to	it	listen	to	it	listen	to	it
my	markov	bot	was	also	on	buzzfeed	it	catches	a	lot	of	gaters
putting	them	both	on	the	same	app	secret	key	just	diff	user	creds	adding	more	sources	for	gater_ebooks	doing	some	filesystem	cleanup
github	has	been	great	for	that	love	them
i	want	a	panel	of	women	in	tech	tearing	this	shit	up
wow	really
my	new	mascot
fuck	yes	was	on	npr	via
sigh	he	accused	me	of	racism	for	what	i	have	no	idea
ughhhh
the	fact	that	twitter	makes	it	easier	to	interact	with	those	you	're	not	connected	to	may	have	more	to	do	with	this
i	've	been	talking	to	2	employees	and	i	heard	about	a	lot	of	the	internal	politics	re	gg	it	's	enough	to	make	me	stay
rt	patch	6.1	ptr	build	19597	heirloom	ui	brf	tuning	blue	tweets	amr	brf	wipe	rates
presented	without	comment
block	while	waiting	indefinitely	on	data	from	a	filehandle
and	i	can	make	that	markov	bot	fight	with	my	markov	bot	on	command	watch
if	you	follow	they	follow	back	and	then	randomly	rt	fav	your	stuff	if	they	like	it	it	's	weird
the	worst	part	of	buying	furniture	from	ikea	is	having	to	bring	it	from	the	parking	garage	into	my	apartment	do	n't	wanna
that	no	one	has	contested	it	's	an	old	and	tiresome	trick	used	by	trolls	and	pseudo	feminists	all	the	time
the	fight	between	both	of	them	will	keep	going	until	i	stop	it	or	until	the	script	restarts	when	pulling	in	a	new	cache	1d
it	's	cool	i	'm	sure	is	going	to	say	npr	was	just	calling	him	out	for	the	attention	right
attn	all	i	'm	taking	down	for	maintenance	tonight	for	lt;1hr	block	lists	will	still	function	just	not	markov
yup
i	'm	an	engineer	w/15	yrs	exp	and	i	get	mansplained	career	advice	by	dudes	with	1/2	the	xp	and	bad	life	decisions
android	is	for	jerks
hell	now	they	'll	know	i	've	been	your	sockpuppet	all	along
so	in	short	there	's	just	not	enough	data	to	tell	^.^
your	hair	looks	amazing
i	know	that	feel
tell	me	what	you	think	about	ethics
they	made	mistakes	in	the	past	i	hope	they	've	learned	but	the	way	they	treated	the	gg	situation	has	been	outstanding
hey	do	you	have	a	good	way	to	consume	multiple	json	dumps	into	a	single	corpus	i	've	been	just	hacking	it	together
best	earrings
however	it	does	n't	scale	i	can	use	this	to	track	up	to	a	certain	number	of	users	if	they	target	a	user	i	'm	not	looking	at	wo	n't	work
or	it	's	not	responding	to	kill	signals	weeeeird	because	i	ran	the	script	manually	and	it	worked
rofl
in	the	past	12h	is	seeing	the	most	targeted	abuse	with	194	36	oc/158	rt	gg	hashtaged	tweets	mentioning	her	congrats
go	figure	that	silicon	valley	circle	jerk	elite	do	n't	realize	that	some	people	ca	n't	afford	$	10/month	to	not	be	harassed
take	off	your	vc	fedoras	and	think	about	what	this	really	is	it	's	about	the	right	that	anyone	has	to	not	be	harassed	amp	threatened
i	hate	configuring	retention	policies	and	flush	intervals	in	statsd	graphite	ughhhh
it	's	what	i	'm	trying	to	do	at	least	targeting	specific	groups	causes	it	's	tricky	have	to	look	more	at	statistics	than	words
unaware	of	their	issues	do	they	not	have	cell	phones	access	to	gv
this	is	followed	not	so	closely	by	with	80	44	oc/36	rt	gg	hashtagged	tweets	mentioning	her	better	luck	next	time
they	are	all	pretty	much	synonyms	cigarette	pencil	skinny	etc
i	'm	starting	to	get	a	grasp	for	when	the	notification	ugliness	is	going	to	happen	so	it	could	be	an	interesting	incident	notification	tool
i	love	amazon	basics	for	misc	accessories	but	why	does	the	power	brick	for	this	usb	hub	have	to	be	so	big
summarize(stats.counters.tweetstats.hashtag.all.count,'5m','sum
or	so	i	can	direct	parents	there	around	xmas	time	:p
he	's	ok	if	we	were	stranded	both	hungry	and	i	had	a	sandwich	i	would	probably	give	him	half
looking	into	it	ty	for	the	headsup
it	's	very	easy	to	change	your	gv
whispers	hey	guys	being	free	from	abuse	harassment	does	n't	have	to	be	monetized	it	should	be	for	everyone	i	can	show	you	the	way
the	number	does	n't	have	to	be	stored	to	be	ensured	unique
that	's	about	4	i	think
this	is	n't	de	anonymizing	the	phone	n't	necessarily	be	stored	no	names	would	be	required
pseudonyms	are	good	own	it	anonymous	is	not	the	same	thing	what	jason	wadhwa	are	promoting	would	require	id	home	address	pay	to	use
yeah	i	've	got	a	cron	to	kick	it	it	must	not	be	kicking	it	properly
but	that	seems	gross	and	not	really	how	this	tool	should	be	used	can	do	better	w	other	things	this	is	more	for	an	overview
but	if	they	do	i	'm	happy	to	turn	my	graphs	over	to	twitter	's	abuse	department	i	do	n't	think	the	people	i	'm	watching	would	risk	that
verified	accts	for	all	is	an	ok	idea	but	too	much	administrative	overhead	there	are	better	ways	which	i	've	talked	about	in	the	past
eh	it	happened	i	did	n't	set	out	to	lose	weight	or	anything
ie	things	not	as	open	for	interpretation	such	as	numeric	or	boolean	data	is	following	is	not	following	etc
why	would	it
i	was	talking	to	twitter	about	it	a	few	weeks	ago	talked	about	it	here	a	month	ago	neener	:p
thanks	more	fun	stuff	coming	soon
getting	into	inst	is	slow	it	's	oomed	prob	going	to	have	to	aws	console	and	kick	it
totes	sjw
just	a	reminder	this	is	the	kind	of	logic	amp	reasoning	that	we	've	come	to	expect	from	gg
i	just	saw	that	3	people	requested	that	i	update	my	amazon	wish	list	hm	i	usually	only	use	it	to	track	things	i	plan	on	buying	eventually
i	have	no	idea	what	these	mean	requestcontext	serieslist	guessing	intervalstring	would	be	5	m
not	everyone	can	afford	cell	phones	gv	is	a	good	alternative	we	do	n't	want	to	turn	twitter	into	a	classist	thing
disclaimer	none	of	these	things	i	'm	about	to	tell	you	are	100	accurate	just	mostly	accurate	there	are	always	exceptions
in	web	yes	clients	other	than	web	immediately	delete	tweets
oh	dear
phone	is	n't	perfect	it	's	easy	enough	to	grab	a	phone	gv	but	it	's	an	extra	step	good	deterrent	for	majority	of	abuse
wsp	is	sigh	but	i	'm	just	using	docker	in	aws	with	a	grafana	image	fuck	configuring	this	crap
devopsing	so	hard	right	now
it	's	not	a	battery	it	's	a	usb	hub
the	goal	here	is	to	eventually	have	up	a	pretty	dashboard	where	you	can	go	and	see	up	to	the	minute	stats	on	this	stuff
weird	i	have	an	address	on	my	account	not	sure	if	i	need	to	add	that	to	my	wishlist	or	not
it	's	a	nice	update	i	quite	like	it
no	something	went	awry	box	ran	out	of	memory	it	's	also	a	dev	box
so	my	yammering	sleazeball	cupcakes	you	can	go	with	and	i	'll	go	my	way	i	fight	for	the	users
ca	n't	wait	until	i	get	more	data	on	this	but	it	looks	like	should	probably	avoid	her	mentions	at	8	10am	pdt	sundays
yeah	i	'm	kind	of	feeling	like	for	what	i	'm	doing	wsp	is	ok	for	doing	more	granular	monitoring	redis	would	be	good
tweets	which	saw	the	most	rts	tend	to	be	questionable	abusive	and	almost	always	aimed	at	and	me
we	could	do	something	fun	with	this	i	could	see	how	many	tweets	you	get	from	users	you	've	blocked
oh	darn	you	ca	n't	shoot
however	twitter	clients	and	web	are	supposed	to	have	the	same	tools	exp	that	's	why	devpolicy	does	n't	really	encourage	3rd	party	clients
you	do	n't	have	to	have	a	phone	to	get	sms	you	have	to	have	internet	which	is	also	required	for	twitter
it	's	really	fun	watching	patterns	emerge	in	all	of	this	regarding	various	groups	i	think	it	'll	be	useful
in	the	past	12	hrs	gg	hashtag	saw	1018	tweets	hr	776	of	which	were	rts	min	662	473	max	1519	1233	majority	of	non	rt	came	from	bot
so	i	guess	i	need	new	jeans	or	a	belt	or	maybe	just	some	cat5	if	i	'm	keeping	it	real
i	got	statsd	graphite	working	on	freebsd	once	but	then	i	switched	to	connected	line	graphs	and	it	crashed
it	would	be	possible	with	a	super	low	retention	for	graphs	i	guess	and	.wsp	files	that	are	deleted	if	they	are	n't	updated	in	n	minutes
no	pretty	graphs	easily	generated	out	of	redis	tho	i	'd	have	to	learn	r	or	somesuch
the	latest	version	does	n't	take	this	into	account	iirc	i	just	added	it	to	my	custom	bot	blacklist
verified	accounts	have	features	that	other	accounts	do	not	not	sure	what	kind	of	overhead	increasing	that	have
rather	amused	that	despite	their	protests	gg	is	the	only	group	i	've	looked	at	where	abuse	is	easily	predicted	based	on	followers
well	find	me	some	tweets	where	the	hashtag	is	mentioned	+	us	saying	something	that	is	n't	questionable	or	abusive
add	a	filter	to	toggle	showing	phone	verified	accts	in	clients	requires	devpolicy	update	natch
a	lot	of	people	do	n't	have	cell	phones	i	was	one	of	them	for	2	years	i	only	used	gv	against	the	idea	of	disallowing	gv
rt	probably	uses	ggautoblocker	which	she	authored	which	blocks	lots	of	innocents	totally	not
when	we	look	at	all	mentions	of	a	username	including	rts	has	received	1611	in	the	past	12h	has	received	911
rt	could	've	fooled	anyone	was	this	too	subtle
automated	programs	whatever	it	's	not	clearly	written
i	think	we	really	need	to	talk	about	these	too
do	n't	worry	i	'm	sure	no	one	will	be	like	what	a	great	idea	until	a	dude	takes	credit	for	it	lt;3
unclear	tos	prevents	bots	from	being	able	to	contact	you	without	you	contacting	them	first	iirc
i	love	those	too	much	too	much
hm
hmm	using	grafana	and	it	's	giving	me	errors
i	've	seen	some	strong	proof	that	people	in	the	middle	east	are	using	online	solutions	for	sms
it	is	really	not	at	all	surprising	to	me	that	wadhwa	and	jason	are	both	promoting	a	solution	that	removes	pseudonymity
literally
i	do	n't	wanna	devops	this	i	just	want	it	to	work	so	i	can	do	other	things	i	need	a	devops
they	are	already	setting	up	bots	to	tweet	with	the	hashtag	to	inflate	it	i	do	n't	really	see	this	making	much	of	a	difference
i	have	n't	really	had	to	go	plonking	around	in	graphite	before	this	stuff	is	practically	a	foreign	language
gag
in	short	there	needs	to	be	a	verified	that	is	n't	verified	requiring	govt	ids	will	cause	probs	unique	phone	less	problematic	not	perfect
been	doing	things	going	to	have	some	pretty	automated	stuff	to	show	you	all	soon	but	for	now	some	kinda	neat	stuff	i	found
so	faded	:p	need	a	hair	cut	+	dye	desperately

i	'm	trying	to	have	a	conversation	why	do	you	think	it	's	a	fight
just	because	i	disagree	with	you	does	n't	mean	i	have	strong	feelings	about	you	i	just	dislike	your	solution
yup	i	know	the	drill
anything	that	requires	a	government	id	is	a	privacy	concern	anything	that	requires	money	is	a	bad	idea	forever
is	n't	everyone
uhh	through	what	point	of	ingress
i	'm	still	entertained	that	jason	's	idea	is	to	either	pay	a	fee	or	make	your	acct	protected	i	'd	love	to	hear	his	thoughts	on	short	skirts
given	that	he	already	used	his	low	twitter	userid	to	brag	about	his	worth	i	should	n't	be	shocked	that	he	wants	twitter	to	be	classist
the	client	web	experience	being	similar	are	key	i	do	n't	know	if	twitter	client	has	the	additional	controls	verified	accts	have
you	can	only	have	one	gv	acct	at	any	given	time
also	lol	at	senior	position	because	it	's	an	employer	with	titles	apparently
as	a	guess	anyways
what	is	n't	p
rt	everything	wrong	with	everything	in	a	single	screenshot
i	've	seen	the	mod	claim	that	i	doxxed	them	but	i	have	no	idea	who	they	even	are	screencap	in	case	deleted
i	was	mostly	with	you	until	you	started	talking	about	charging	a	fee	this	is	a	horrible	idea
you	ca	n't	mute	hashtags	that	's	a	violation	of	twitter	developer	policy	which	is	why	it	's	only	implemented	in	older	clients
donating	blood	tomorrow	pretty	sure	that	i	bleed	twitter	json	metadata	at	this	point
freebsd	is	in	fact	a	person	yo	you	hear	about	this	why	are	we	not	besties	anymore
according	to	ralphreject	gdc	is	just	a	place	for	rich	people	to	drink	do	drugs	jeez	guys	i	guess	i	'll	bring	enough	wine	to	share	then

will	make	a	blog	post	out	of	the	contents	of	talk	+	slides	which	are	limited	i	prefer	not	using	slides

sigh

then	q&amp;a	for	both	of	us	keynote	speakers	got	hijacked	to	show	harassment	happening	live	both	of	us	talked	about	diff	aspects	of	harassment
i	keep	hearing	that	gamergate	is	opposed	to	harassment	i	must	be	misunderstanding	something	surely

best	part	about	my	style	amp	not	having	a	precision	cut	is	that	i	can	scream	fuck	you	hair	while	randomly	jabbing	hacking	w	box	cutters

i	'd	tweet	about	it	but	i	was	worried	you	might	get	harassed	i	thought	you	were	fantastic

feeling	kind	of	fantastic	after	standing	on	a	stage	to	tell	amp	show	people	my	experiences	being	harassed	as	a	vocal	woman	in	tech

it	's	pretty	funny	that	gamergate	thinks	i	'm	profiting	from	harassment	i	took	a	huge	pay	cut	by	going	full	time	with	this
it	's	pretty	funny	that	georgie	claims	i	harassed	her	never	talked	to	her	until	last	night	ignored	the	smear	article	she	wrote
not	sure	i	did	n't	see	it
gamergate	started	harassing	's	organizer	so	we	spent	the	q&amp;a	livestreaming	the	tweets	and	discussing	harassment

in	regards	to	being	harassed	by	gamergate	i	was	just	told	let	your	experience	better	you	as	a	woman	instead	of	seeking	sympathy
i	think	did	that	in	her	first	blog	post	about	him	doing	it	programmatically	is	really	hard

how	many	angles	does	my	fist	need	i	don't	understand
rt	i	disagree	with	.@wadhwa	but	makes	me	wonder	if	he	's	not	an	easy	target	for	being	an	immigrant	lesson
would	n't	have	to	use	the	api	i	've	got	other	methods
i	would	rather	deal	with	an	mra	than	wadhwa
wowwwww	this	whole	thread
it	did	feel	like	there	was	n't	much	point	to	it	other	than	ratings	a	quick	win	based	on	current	controversy
she	also	claimed	that	women	being	angry	with	wadhwa	was	worse	than	the	death	threats	we	were	getting	because	we	're	used	to	it
do	n't	try	to	turn	this	into	an	immigration	issue	we	could	care	less	where	he	's	from	we	do	n't	want	him	to	speak	for	us
do	n't	try	to	explain	the	internet	to	women	via
so	that	's	not	creepy	or	threatening	at	all	look	at	all	the	gaters	that	retweeted	it
so	i	implore	you	to	not	support	any	of	her	projects	if	you	've	already	contributed	towards	her	book	pull	out	this	is	horrible
y'know	what	i	need	a	night	off	running	way	to	make	popcorn	and	catch	up	on
it	's	difficult	deciding	to	call	out	something	as	being	problematic	because	that	gives	it	attention	amp	not	many	people	know	about	it
rt	.@freebsdgirl	yes	that	's	what	i	want	in	a	valentine	morbid	self	destructive	obsession	with	my	demise
sorry	to	disappoint	but	i	think	i	'm	already	a	pretty	awesome	women	a	low	self	esteem	continues	to	not	be	an	issue
yup
oops	i	just	woke	up	from	a	nap	p
leaning	in	is	n't	a	bad	solution	it	's	just	not	the	only	solution	it	's	expecting	women	to	solve	all	the	problems

uh	no	hosted	wordpress	i	do	not	want	you	to	manage	my	dns
yes	and	you	are	adorable	^.^
i	do	n't	use	addons	anymore
so	um	how	did	you	keep	from	laughing	or	hanging	up	i	'm	in	awe
can	we	just	take	a	moment	and	reflect	on	everything	that	is	wrong	with	this	paragraph	by	wadhwa
yup
wadhwa	is	now	blaming	npr	for	bad	health
only	the	existence	of	a	sexual	history
almost	everyone	i	know	that	takes	cabs	uses	uber	they	just	feel	really	bad	about	it
who	wants	to	take	bets	on	if	he	starts	talking	about	how	disappointed	he	is	in	uppity	women
rt	in	which	only	calls	out	the	women	who	criticize	him	and	not	the	men
there	's	some	good	info	in	the	talk	section	on	wadhwa	's	wikipedia	page	^.^	too	bad	it	did	n't	make	it	to	the	main	article
i	do	n't	use	addons	anymore	:p
i	have	no	idea	what	red	bean	tastes	like	i	'm	assuming	it	tastes	like	beans	i	'm	not	really	down	with	beans
.@wadhwa	keeps	claiming	he	's	not	profiting	look	dude	we	both	know	how	the	speaker	circuit	works	it	's	about	rep	you	profit	indirectly
throwback	to	when	vivek	offered	to	show	me	around	su	to	shut	me	up
ca	n't	believe	he	did	that	again	jesus	hey	dudes	do	n't	do	that	not	ever	ask	yourself	would	i	do	this	to	a	guy	no	then	fucking	stop
rt	did	n't	he	say	this	was	a	big	problem	women	in	silicon	valley	had	in	that	newsweek	article	being	too	humble
rt	vivek	offers	a	fresh	perspective	on	diversity	in	the	next	dean	's	lecture
listen	to	the	latest	episode	it	's	all	explained
but	wadhwa	just	writes	off	women	on	social	media	as	being	uninformed	or	not	even	real	because	we	do	n't	agree	with	him
cleaning	up	old	screenshots	folder	found	i	miss	these	people	those	stacks	so	many	stacks
meredith	mr	wadhwa	i	would	love	to	broadcast	this	entire	interview	the	way	it	is	dead	silence	from	wadhwa
lolllllll
rt	there	is	no	attack	all	changes	today	are	factual	cited	adhere	to	wikipedia	's	editorial	guidelines
all	of	these	quotes	are	from	on
women	do	n't	understand	how	journalism	works	that	i	have	given	women	a	platform
world	of	warcraft	related	things
eggs	and	other	things	which	will	unfortunately	be	the	only	part	likely	not	open	sourced
siiiiigh
a	number	of	variables	i	've	only	run	it	against	a	small	subset	of	accounts	it	's	fairly	intensive	still	in	beta
with	500	user	tokens	it	should	n't	take	long	oh	darlings	i	'm	scared	of	no	army	i	've	got	an	app	for	that
the	whole	me	being	republican	thing	must	really	bug	these	right	wing	nutjobs	that	dislike	me	so	much
my	views	are	largely	tempered	by	my	former	tax	bracket	and	although	i	like	the	idea	of	flat	tax	does	n't	work	well	at	pov	lvl
rt	i	've	been	told	that	the	rules	are	my	responsibility	and	no	one	can	show	them
ruby	seems	like	it	would	have	a	lot	of	stuff	that	you	do	n't	have	to	learn	so	i	can	write	code	in	it	but	far	to	go
have	n't	run	it	against	you
lol	time	to	look	at	a	new	social	group	and	write	a	blocklist	i	guess
lol	is	she	still	screeching	about	me	blocking	her	what	a	turd
part	of	the	reason	i	'm	not	actively	using	it	that	much	is	because	the	weights	of	each	factor	are	still	being	decided
maybe	but	travel	lodging	would	have	to	be	covered
lol	why	do	people	think	that	mentioning	a	username	when	you	've	got	them	blocked	is	a	tos	violation
i	've	submitted	a	similar	talk	for	and	i	'll	be	writing	it	regardless	if	anyone	on	the	west	coast	has	a	venue	for	it	happy	to	talk
omg	omg	omg	i	think	they	just	asked	if	obama	made	ggautoblocker
nope	did	n't	have	you	blocked	but	thanks	for	letting	me	know	that	i	should
i	've	got	redirects	set	up	so	existing	articles	posts	that	linked	to	the	old	urls	should	work	just	fine
eh	it	does	n't	bother	me
nope	i	had	to	manually	block	her
blocking	people	is	the	twitter	version	of	not	making	eye	contact	w	the	people	handing	out	conspiracy	theorist	flyers	at	civic	center	bart
rt	i	'm	in	the	security	area	of	where	they	have	told	me	my	eyeglass	screwdriver	is	to	be	confiscated	tho	no	one	will	say	wh
people	seem	to	have	a	really	warped	view	of	what	republican	even	means	lately	party	lines	have	majorly	shifted
is	he	creating	a	new	account	or	changing	his	username
what	are	your	thoughts	on	attaching	a	comic	as	a	image	to	tweet	with	attribution	to	source	url	author
oh	i	'm	mostly	entertained	if	it	gets	to	be	excessive	i	'll	just	code	a	way	around	it
not	sure	if	it	would	be	a	good	fit	it	's	about	harassment	creating	foss	tools	and	diversity	in	open	source	communities
has	always	been	my	favorite	conference	ca	n't	speak	highly	enough	of	the	community	please	sponsor	^.^
i	keep	seeing	people	saying	this	and	it	's	not	a	thing	feel	free	to	point	out	the	clause	in	the	tos	if	i	'm	wrong	though
if	my	day	does	n't	get	completely	run	off	the	tracks	i	've	got	a	bunch	of	writing	to	do	and	blog	posts	to	schedule	some	quick	wins
yup	although	i	have	n't	really	been	able	to	vote	that	way	in	a	while	it	's	getting	more	difficult	to	find	sane	repubs
it	's	good	to	see	there	are	still	some	pro	choice	pro	gay	marriage	repubs	just	hard	to	find
yeah	but	if	you	live	your	life	by	what	makes	other	people	happy	or	unhappy	then	they	've	won	anyways
the	end	result	is	the	same
rt	i	'm	refusing	to	deal	with	this	passenger
follower	vs	following	ratio	acct	date	profile	image	entities	used	hashtags	urls	users	mentioned	oc	vs	rt
this	is	basically	going	to	be	like	antispam	but	for	tweets	:p
we	're	totes	not	dog	piling	but	just	so	you	know	you	should	be	scared	of	us	bunnies	yeahhhh
rt	i	've	been	told	that	my	screwdriver	bits	are	allowed	and	the	handle	is	allowed	but	not	together
yeah	someone	dmed	me	a	screenshot	meh	let	her	i	have	no	idea	who	she	even	is
pro	death	penalty	anti	some	provisions	of	obamacare	fewer	govt	regulations	free	market	better	but
it	should	be	removed	if	you	refresh	i	think
no	i	'm	not	telling	anyone	what	their	score	is	then	it	'll	just	turn	into	a	contest	for	gamergate	to	try	to	win
if	a	monk	has	touch	of	karma	up	on	someone	else	and	i	keep	attacking	why	do	n't	i	get	the	killing	blow	credit	when	my	teammate	dies	;d
users	you	're	following	along	with	their	troll	score	plays	a	factor	users	you	rt	of	tweets	that	are	sea	lioning
rt	they	have	told	me	that	writing	this	down	is	intimidation
no	clue	who	is	but	she	just	set	her	followers	on	me	yayyy	mention	spam
rt	i	suspect	the	bsdcan	list	of	selected	talks	will	not	be	available	today	the	program	committee	is	discussing	some	importa
rt
not	really	i	blocked	her	someone	that	likes	to	sick	nutballs	on	people
clearly	does	n't	understand	the	difference	between	censorship	and	people	just	not	wanting	to	talk	to	her
i	've	got	the	code	to	interpret	amp	analyze	but	the	weights	themselves	are	going	to	take	a	lot	of	fiddling
when	you	have	that	many	followers	you	know	precisely	what	happens
would	have	to	see	what	kind	of	stuff	you	'd	want	me	to	present	on	most	expertise	now	is	anti	harassment	tools	amp	devops
too	busy	playing	video	games	to	deal	with	it	blocked	a	bunch	i	'll	handle	it	later	lt;3
i	did	n't	even	know	random	was	an	option
ignore	those	tweets	site	maintenance	stuff	it	was	autonotifying	turned	that	garbage	right	off
i	do	n't	use	freebsd	as	a	desktop
i	do	n't	mind	bickering	but	with	some	it	feels	like	kicking	puppies	i	'm	anti	puppy	kicking
had	the	mention	been	1st	it	would	n't	have	been	public	but	a	priv	conv	but	when	you	do	n't	it	's	public
hey	guys	the	mras	found	me	oh	noes	whatever	will	i	do	as	a	damsel	in	distress	oh	gosh	plz	stop	such	a	hapless	victim
frost	for	now	still	learning	how	to	play	for	bgs	seems	to	work	well
see	this	thread	:p
oh	look	threats	no	i	really	do	n't	care
now	i	know	where	to	find	the	people	that	stand	in	fire
people	reply	and	mentions	get	inundated	yay
and	then	i	got	a	crapton	of	mentions	i	do	n't	think	you	understand	how	the	in_reply_to_user_id	json	key	works
i	love	perl	but	i	think	i	'm	starting	to	shift	towards	ruby	gem	is	nice	docs	are	horrid	need	to	read	more	about	classes

it	's	only	open	because	i	was	asked	but	no	hard	feelings	good	luck
i	think	i	successfully	migrated	can	y'	all	go	play	around	and	see	if	you	can	find	anything	that	's	broken
most	seem	to	think	god	is	literally	talking	to	them	i	'm	not	fond	of	those

remember	when
that	's	why	there	are	many	factors	:p	matching	1	or	2	variables	is	expected
she	must	not	realize	that	blocking	people	is	sorrrrrta	what	i	'm	famous	for

frankly	i	have	more	legal	and	tech	resources	than	a	hashtag	plese	go	spew	your	hate	group	propaganda	elsewhere
only	when	it	counts	i	'm	pretty	snarky	when	it	's	not	serious	times	you	know
someone	posted	this	on	facebook	in	response	to	that	woman	tweeting	at	me	earlier	today	^.^
aw	i	was	talking	to	a	gater	on	reddit	for	the	past	few	weeks	he	seemed	nice	enough	but	he	just	deleted	his	account	come	back	dude
ah	hah
try	$	35	:p
if	you	reallllly	want	that	search	for	ggautoblocker	i	ran	some	ads	last	night
even	with	twitter	allowing	pseudonyms	it	does	n't	really	prevent	the	trolls	from	tracking	them	down
i	'm	looking	for	a	few	people	to	help	with	's	twitter	log	amp	categorize	mentions	as	support	requests	abusive	positive	tweets
we	can	tweet	each	other	in	all	caps	while	we	are	at	the	pub	if	that	's	your	thing

plz	stop	posting	pics	of	me	that	i	posted	a	few	weeks	ago	i	care	so	much	about	what	people	think	of	my	appearance	it	's	what	i	live	for
i	said	it	in	2014	too	likely	2013	2012	2011	might	want	to	attribute	all	the	years
i	'm	bothered	by	the	attitude	from	every	poster	in	that	thread	in	general	but	i	might	just	be	grumpy
oh	god	oh	god	oh	god	never	point	a	microscope	at	skin
twitter	is	n't	really	optimal	for	long	conversations
it	was	incredibly	fucking	difficult	to	type	that
that	guy	kept	going	for	a	while	too	i	think	he	proposed	are	we	married	now	does	this	mean	i	have	health	insurance
is	the	one	i	got	if	you	get	it	do	n't	install	their	drivers	just	use	default	webcam	drivers
oh	darling	mras	you	making	jabs	at	my	appearance	wo	n't	keep	me	from	working	to	provide	tools	so	others	can	shut	you	down	lt;3
everyone	is	awkward	:p	most	people	think	they	are	most	awkward	than	they	really	are	you	're	fine
but	i	guess	you	're	not	really	sure	how	to	react	when	a	woman	has	resources	to	help	others	fight	back	such	a	quandary	so	perplexing
ca	has	some	interesting	ways	of	getting	around	jurisdiction	issues	still	researching	other	states
sorry	i	do	n't	believe	in	gamergate	's	version	of	justice	mass	reporting	is	n't	dealing	with	anything
i	have	no	idea	wtf	is	going	on	or	why	i	am	mentioned	in	this	tweet
lt;3
woops
i	think	it	's	because	i	'm	too	tired	to	have	feelings
the	guy	who	paid
please	stop	with	all	of	the	karma	negative	comments	there	's	a	bigger	issue	here	than	the	person	that	was	targeted
possibly	respond	to	some	support	requests	with	canned	answers
the	current	system	is	inadequate	some	of	us	are	experienced	at	navigating	these	pitfalls	and	we	can	help	you
weird
oh	yeah	i	spam	the	hell	out	of	those	buttons
i	'm	not	going	to	say	i	told	you	so	however	i	will	say	that	you	'll	probably	see	this	and	you	know	my	email	address	if	you	need	help
in	many	states	we	've	got	laws	that	specifically	protect	against	this	kind	of	thing	however	they	are	n't	enforced	due	to	education	funding
not	quite	yet	as	far	as	tooling	goes	although	i	've	been	thinking	about	facebook	i	've	been	working	with	many	companies	though
i	doubt	he	'll	bother	emailing	but	despite	his	past	actions	no	one	should	have	to	deal	with	shit	like	this
a	lot	of	you	are	new	followers	since	november	so	i	think	this	bears	a	reshare	my	story
it	is	really	funny	all	the	assumptions	they	make	about	how	it	works	and	how	much	they	are	wrong
rt	we	've	got	a	facebook	page	if	you	need	support	or	want	to	stay	tuned	for	the	latest	announcements	join	us	at
is	n't	it	supposed	to	be	keep	emailing	:p	via
if	your	friend	needs	help	knowing	how	to	talk	to	police	prevention	etc	they	should	talk	to	or	myself
i	know	of	at	least	3	people	that	are	dealing	with	police	today	after	being	doxxed	on	8chan	trying	to	be	available	if	i	'm	needed
that	's	actually	kind	of	interesting	i	'll	give	them	a	call	later	next	week	i	need	to	talk	to	them	anyways
that	's	not	funny
it	's	true	there	's	a	risk	but	the	same	risk	is	involved	in	just	following	the	twitter	account
several	people	have	pointed	out	where	were	you	when	i	needed	you	for	life	advice	xkcd
yup
i	had	a	rescue	puppy	named	rj45
rt	oh	lord	she	's	filing	a	false	report	on	you	for	supposed	false	reporting
aw	thanks
when	the	most	you	've	got	to	throw	at	me	is	tweeting	insults	you	do	n't	really	have	any	weapon	at	all
i	think	that	this	person	did	n't	like	some	of	the	behavior	too	perhaps	why	they	deleted	their	account
have	2	team	members	sticking	with	this	for	now	thanks	everyone	^.^
weird	guessing	that	she	'll	be	back	i	do	n't	really	understand	why	people	delete	their	accts	vs	just	closing	twitter	app
shot	her	an	email
not	necessarily
rt	this	guy	thinks	i	'm	randi	harper	have	we	met

i	've	posted	a	contact	form	at	for	support	regarding	speaking	requests	feedback	etc
i	would	love	that	would	you	mind	dming	me	your	email	address	can	shoot	you	an	email	later	today
also	mentioning	both	of	us	in	the	same	tweet	is	pretty	much	a	sure	fire	way	to	make	sure	that	they	do	notice	amp	jump	on	me
i	'm	very	entertained	that	all	it	takes	is	155	iq	for	me	to	know	precisely	who	is	being	discussed
oh	gosh	i	hope	you	feel	better
looks	neat	i	need	to	start	keeping	my	eyes	open	for	cfps
while	you	can	hire	a	lawyer	to	help	you	speak	to	the	police	that	's	kind	of	where	their	and	your	involvement	ends
he	's	said	that	he	's	backing	out	but	i	think	this	remains	to	be	seen	however	i	'm	optimistic
i	'm	nervous	in	a	weird	way	because	these	people	are	kind	of	like	my	extended	family	it	's	not	a	hard	talk	to	give	to	strangers

please	untag	me	from	all	of	this	it	's	spamming	my	notifications
this	is	a	criminal	case	not	a	civil	case	this	means	that	it	's	up	to	the	police	to	decide	if	it	's	worth	prosecuting
i	'm	almost	in	sniffles	at	the	thought	of	seeing	my	freebsd	extended	family	again	after	so	many	years	clearly	i	need	more	sleep
mostly	joan	jett	lyrics
that	's	likely	the	same	person	i	'm	talking	about
ah	okay
i	have	no	idea	why	this	is	n't	already	a	thing	it	's	not	like	there	are	n't	console	mp3	playing	apps
if	someone	has	had	a	crime	committed	personally	against	them	online	the	police	are	n't	likely	to	listen	to	anyone	but	them
if	not	anonymous	then	at	the	very	least	privileged	information
no	one	from	requiem	ever	goes	they	are	too	antisocial
til	i	'm	the	district	attorney
you	're	going	to	be	in	town	:d	yay
everyone	should	be	jealous	of	my	coffee	maker	our	love	is	pure

thank	you	^.^
rt	ceo	of	sony	europe	vehemently	unequivocally	condemns	as	misogynistic	harassment
sigh	i	need	to	work	on	building	out	my	legal	contacts	to	encompass	more	states
i	know	that	feel
these	would	likely	fall	under	the	lines	of	pro	bono	work	at	least	until	my	npo	is	up	to	help	fund
we	ca	n't	take	any	action	other	than	offering	advice	and	assistance	person	targeted	has	to	report	it	to	police
general	folks	in	the	legal	field	at	this	point	but	issues	will	mostly	center	around	local	harassment	stalking	laws
hi	i	still	saw	your	tweet	one	i	'm	female	obviously	two	this	is	n't	helping
amp	possibly	being	able	to	provide	referrals	for	people	that	want	someone	to	help	them	navigate	reporting	to	pd
it	does	n't	surprise	me	that	gg	has	turned	my	offer	of	help	for	one	of	their	own	into	a	reason	to	screech	at	me	but	it	's	still	irritating
i	'm	not	linking	doxx
waiting	for	outrage	you	'll	see
nice	interface	much	prettier	than	the	grafana	setup	that	i	'm	using
so	please	take	your	accusations	of	why	aren't	you	prosecuting	evil	antigg	scum	and	go	educate	yourself
anyone	that	is	getting	harassed	is	welcome	to	come	to	me	for	help	it	's	all	anonymous
i	have	no	intent	on	linking	to	the	articles	where	he	stated	he	was	backing	out	they	were	an	attempt	to	save	face	not	an	apology
more	so	because	they	've	known	me	for	such	a	long	time	talking	about	polarizing	personal	experiences	is	easier	with	strangers
as	to	if	i	'm	working	with	her	that	's	none	of	your	business	this	is	n't	an	adequate	use	of	your	time	shoo
yo	you	planning	on	going	to	blizzcon	this	year
rt	if	there	is	a	culture	war	to	be	fought	it	should	over	whether	or	not	harassment	is	acceptable	not	when	i
the	rule	of	the	apple	mini	displayport	to	dvi	adapter	is	that	you	will	never	be	able	to	find	it	when	you	finally	need	it
i	feel	weird	putting	up	quick	little	posts	like	that	like	it	's	lazy	and	bad	but	i	think	it	's	a	conversation	that	needs	to	be	had
oh	you	have	n't	heard	it	it	was	amazing
it	's	not	pink
rt
i	'm	going	to	cut	in	here	despite	blocking	you	to	explain	something	that	seems	to	confuse	many	people
yay	my	talk	got	accepted	at	see	the	full	list	of	talks	here

this	is	mostly	what	i	need	interesting	to	see	that	some	states	do	n't	have	statues	on	both

well	that	just	made	my	life	much	easier	:p

that	's	ah	all	of	my	kitchen	really	i	have	a	thing	for	english	tea	roses	patterns	too
the	contact	form	on	the	site	was	bugged	turns	out	that	if	you	use	a	in	the	email	subject	prefix	it	breaks	everything	silly	wordpress

it	was	difficult	for	me	as	well	until	i	realized	that	one	could	be	a	victim	and	still	fight	back
that	would	be	awesome	lt;3
ugh	what	did	he	do	this	time
this	is	not	legal	advice	but	common	sense	what	i	can	do	is	help	people	know	what	to	say	to	police	or	help	find	a	lawyer
so	do	n't	do	that
for	victims	of	abuse	it	's	often	not	discussed	because	of	a	feeling	of	shame	victim	assumes	fault	then	public	assigns	blame

what	he	did	was	wrong	and	should	be	prosecuted	however	he	's	now	been	doxxed	and	targeted	as	well	it	's	a	clusterfuck

you	're	searching	her	name	and	contacting	people	that	talk	to	her	that	's	a	bit	creepy	stalkerish
i	honestly	have	no	idea	how	i	am	managing	this	it	is	surprising
i	'm	pretty	familiar	with	the	concept	but	not	the	feeling	^.^	good	read	though
do	n't	think	that	it	wo	n't	go	unnoticed	unchallenged	do	n't	put	on	a	cape	unless	you	plan	on	being	a	hero	it	's	not	a	photo	op	it	's	a	job

we	're	all	very	different	people	with	very	different	backstories	and	purposes	but	we	respect	each	other
given	the	massive	glee	i	'm	seeing	from	gg	irt	that	tweet	it	's	concerning	that	he	's	not	retracting	or	explaining	bully
he	's	been	offered	contact	info	from	those	he	's	speaking	with	should	he	care	to	contribute	he	's	utilized	none	of	this	i	am	unimpressed
oh	hell	is	blizzard	proxying	tweets	instead	of	sending	the	tweet	content	directly	to	twitter	from	the	wow	client
rt	things	are	worse	than	normal	this	is	the	new	normal	please	adjust	accordingly
i	used	to	talk	more	shit	now	everything	is	weird	too	much	attention	i	'm	representing	more	than	just	myself
please	no	pile	ons	do	n't	tweet	at	him	etc	i	think	the	conversation	is	concerning	in	that	we	need	to	discuss	what	bully	means
rt	they	don't	even	go	here
the	best	part	about	posting	to	wow	forums	is	that	it	's	only	for	ppl	that	have	played	the	game	amp	thus	will	keep	many	gaters	from	descending
want	more	fun	stuff	google	the	name	of	the	person	i	rted	that	music
i	need	to	think	about	this	i	do	n't	think	i	like	this
i	have	no	idea	how	that	even	works	that	video	is	crazy
the	claims	she	has	made	are	not	something	someone	in	their	right	mind	would	do
at	this	moment	in	time	i	am	unaware	of	any	effort	he	has	made	into	this	space	i	'm	tied	in	w	many	orgs	his	name	has	never	once	come	up
yeah	this	probably	is	n't	a	good	public	conversation	to	have	i	just	stay	away	from	her
verification	yes	this	is	me
you	do	n't	know	that
not	no	time	like	i	do	n't	feel	like	committing	to	this	right	now	but	i	have	to	set	an	alarm	on	my	phone	to	tell	me	to	sleep
if	i	was	looking	for	pitchforks	i	'd	point	out	a	white	dude	in	a	position	of	power	accused	a	minority	of	bullying	him	:p

rt	i	lt;3	both	of	you	the	scene	in	captain	america	with	the	grenade	i	'd	do	that	for	both	of	you	lt;3
it	's	basically	what	we	already	do	in	game	:p
this	thread	this	does	n't	add	up	am	i	missing	something
omg	if	goes	to	there	's	going	to	be	trouble	lt;3
as	the	announcement	date	draws	closer	things	are	starting	to	pick	up	to	a	rather	frantic	pace
i	like	you
i	am	really	curious	as	to	why	is	throwing	around	accusations	of	bullying	when	someone	expresses	an	opinion	irt	writing	direction
i	am	not	sure	if	enabling	twitter	from	within	wow	is	a	good	idea	or	not
tbh	i	feel	bad	anytime	anyone	actively	enters	this	fight	without	knowing	about	the	personal	cost
thank	you	for	calling	me	on	this	though	i	probably	should	have	made	that	more	clear	in	the	original	tweets
a	few	people	poked	me	yesterday	but	i	was	up	to	my	eyeballs	in	meetings	responding	later	this	morning

frankly	it	's	a	little	irritating	to	see	some	guy	with	a	huge	following	come	along	and	say	i	'm	gon	na	do	stuff	and	then	do	nothing
one	of	the	hardest	things	about	not	working	on	a	team	out	of	an	office	is	never	letting	myself	sleep	in	coffee	save	me
there	is	currently	a	vocal	male	on	twitter	that	claims	to	be	all	about	anti	harassment	he	has	defended	gamergate	in	the	past
i	've	given	a	lot	of	tech	talks	in	the	past	this	one	is	n't	really	so	technical	more	community	:p
haha	mine	is	worse	:p
i	'm	talking	about	people	that	take	an	active	stand	to	say	they	want	to	create	solutions	for	harassment	but	do	nothing	beyond	get	rted

holy	shit
looking	at	your	icons	judginggggg
i	'm	still	not	100	certain	this	is	happening	but	the	delay	between	sending	a	tweet	and	seeing	it	appear	is	far	too	long
it	depends	on	how	you	define	meaningful	if	3	people	listen	to	you	vs	30k	there	's	a	huge	difference	in	voice
the	use	of	the	word	bully	in	this	context	is	worrisome	and	relevant	to	any	conversation	i	have

clearly	witchcraft
i	ca	n't	receive	tweets	in	game	only	send	:p
or	well	something	happened	a	hashtag	was	started	by	harassers	to	support	him	so	that	's	something	i	guess
rt
i	think	the	biggest	problem	i	have	with	it	is	that	there	's	too	much	of	a	reliance	on	wow	services	for	an	external	mechanism

i	'm	a	little	concerned	the	tweet	still	exists	i	see	no	retraction	published
pocky	4ever
blizzard	has	had	issues	in	the	past	with	certain	things	being	delayed	achievements	d3	i	would	strongly	dislike	a	tweet	being	delayed

exactly	this
woah	nah	you	're	amazing	and	one	of	my	favorite	people	on	twitter	lt;3
this	is	n't	going	to	work	because	we	've	all	got	a	maturity	greater	than	12	year	olds

oh	yeah	and	freebsd	is	the	os	that	runs	on	your	playstations	why	so	salty
getting	ready	to	kill	stuff	with	my	teammates
so	just	to	save	you	all	some	time	bsd	is	my	family	the	only	negative	response	gg	ever	received	was	from	a	non	dev
i	can	prove	that	my	code	is	in	freebsd	and	there	are	articles	that	state	that	freebsd	is	running	on	the	ps3	and	ps4
in	short	this	is	the	most	hilarious	gamergate	bsd	fail	i	have	ever	seen
there	should	be	a	link	to	this	in	the	patreon
if	i	do	n't	like	who	you	're	following	i	block	you	if	gg	does	n't	like	who	you	're	following	they	go	after	your	job
he	was	already	given	my	email	a	while	ago	by	someone	else
rt	checked	the	tag	w/	amp	w/o	in	place	like	night	amp	day	guess	which	led	to	more	productive	tweets
pc	bsd	is	a	fork	that	is	mostly	funded	by	ixsystems	the	organization	that	runs	freebsd	marketing	it	's	a	frontend	on	top	of	freebsd
bsd	is	a	good	community	wandering	into	it	and	attacking	one	of	the	few	women	contributors	is	going	to	get	some	people	talking
lt;3
i	gave	it	a	5	second	glance	did	n't	see	anything	interesting	getting	mad	about	that	is	like	raging	at	a	livejournal	post	same	quality
i	'd	be	down	for	this
and	i	've	asked	them	to	stay	uninvolved	but	attacking	my	work	with	them	glhf	you	're	bringing	it	on	yourself
rt	how	dare	you	have	feelings	is	a	fantastic	way	to	dehumanize	someone
can	wreck	rogues	when	i	'm	disc	not	so	much	as	shadow	but	all	my	gear	is	heals	:p
i	think	it	was	clefthoof	meat
not	at	my	computer	will	report	a	bug	with	search	amp	blocks	later	not	sure	if	this	is	intentional	or	not	but	it	seems	sub	optimal
i	'm	not	giving	a	talk
well	to	be	more	accurate	i	'll	be	dropping	by	tomorrow	during	lunch	hit	me	up	if	you	want	to	say	hi	:d
yup
rt	gamergate	do	u	even	github
nope	34	in	september
this	is	commonly	found	in	cases	of	domestic	violence	but	it	's	a	favored	tactic	of	gamergate	as	well
but	rogue	is	n't	really	dev	competent	he	thinks	all	dev	happens	under	github
but	all	of	these	attacks	of	not	enough	commits	or	had	a	dude	do	it	for	you	or	slept	with	people	proves	my	point	thanks	for	that
that	's	still	not	my	login	for	freebsd	:p
i	have	never	felt	more	supported	and	safe	than	i	do	around	the	freebsd	developer	community	they	are	amazing	and	i	love	them
presented	without	comment
this	is	the	same	dude	that	thinks	that	not	being	allowed	to	publish	an	article	to	a	site	he	does	n't	own	is	silencing
that	's	fine	^.^
so	far	the	primary	response	i	've	heard	from	the	freebsd	dev	community	in	regards	to	all	of	this	is	how	can	we	help
pointed	freebsd	devs	at	this	thread	their	response	now	discussing	if	they	have	hipster	beards	used	as	an	example
watching	other	bsd	devs	tell	roguestar	he	's	wrong	and	it	is	delicious
i	've	got	this	person	blocked	please	remove	me	from	the	conversation	lt;3
it	's	another	form	of	abuse	but	more	insidious	because	the	perpetrators	think	they	are	the	heroes	of	this	story
perpetuating	a	culture	where	abuse	is	tolerated	and	targets	of	abuse	are	mocked	for	speaking	out	against	their	abusers
rt	lots	of	new	signups	i	'll	be	periodically	checking	this	twitter	account	to	provide	support	as	needed	-rh
it	's	like	christmas
gamergate	is	an	intimidation	mob	speak	up	get	threats	amp	dog	piled	speak	about	the	threats	get	mocked	amp	dog	piled
i	believe	so	should	be	a	client	side	option	blocks	processing	happens	client	side	as	well
it	's	human	to	react	negatively	to	abuse	trying	to	blame	someone	for	reacting	to	abuse	is	unsurprisingly	a	tactic	of	serial	abusers
for	some	parts	of	the	company	yes	a	lot	of	freebsd	devs	work	there
rt	not	all	twitter	clients	apply	your	blocks	to	search	results	however
yah	mgt	fund	fees	are	pretty	low	~$25/year

omg	yes
it	's	really	hard	deciding	what	to	wear	for	a	press	release	that	is	going	to	change	everything

we	know	about	the	typo	and	we	'll	be	fixing	it	:p	we	got	this	together	pretty	quickly	when	we	finally	make	a	decision	we	move	fast
both	of	these	organizations	have	been	created	to	address	different	aspects	of	very	real	problems	that	affect	all	of	us
we	have	seen	so	many	fantastic	things	happen	out	of	this	tragedy	first	we	have	amazing	advocacy	a	voice	that	is	far	reaching
rt	very	cool	news	from	and	about	preventing	online	abuse	hope	this	gets	real	big
sorry	gt;.&gt
i	am	so	fucking	excited	are	you	excited
it	's	a	really	tough	problem	because	it	's	a	big	problem	it	is	far	reaching	it	has	many	different	forms
i	'm	bringing	it	up	for	one	reason	gamergate	has	brought	harassment	into	the	limelight	but	rest	assured	it	's	always	there
lol	sitting	next	to	zynga	management
it	's	also	a	license	i	know	well	i	agree	with	the	philosophy	behind	it
you	are	n't	just	one	person	there	are	many	of	us	and	we	all	have	voices	but	more	than	that	we	have	resources	experience	and	passion
i	do	n't	like	the	gpl
i	was	lucky	enough	to	find	mine	on	a	swap	amp	sell	for	normal	price	i	usally	see	them	on	ebay	for	gt;$400	+
we	will	be	releasing	as	many	tools	as	possible	under	the	bsd	license
listening	to	talk	about	how	harassment	is	important	and	how	we	are	going	to	help	you	through	it
the	scope	of	the	problem	can	discourage	people	from	trying	to	fight	it	often	this	leads	to	thinking	what	can	i	do	i	'm	just	one	person
just	a	few	minutes	until	this	panel	starts	zoe	goes	last	making	the	announcement	when	she	does	teasers	until	then
i	am	hyping	the	fuck	out	of	this	by	just	being	honest	and	people	are	setting	timers	and	stuff
oapi	will	focus	on	creating	technical	solutions	for	online	abuse
me	toooooo

at	some	point	in	the	future	we	will	be	allowing	external	developers	to	contribute
i	'm	so	excited	about	this	we	're	already	doing	some	great	things	and	i	ca	n't	wait	until	i	'm	able	to	tell	you	more
agreed
nope
3	hours	and	40	minutes
we	'll	see	i	'm	still	figuring	out	what	our	tech	amp	infra	concerns	are	going	to	be
file	a	report	with	twitter	if	it	's	urgent	or	twitter	's	abuse	system	does	n't	do	anything	email	me
okay	hey	tech	industry	contacts	i	need	to	talk	to	someone	from	salesforce	atlassian	and	uh	yeah	that	should	be	good	for	now
will	need	a	uh	sales	contact	there	for	a	specific	thing	ca	n't	release	info	until	~4pm
we	're	creating	tools	and	resources	for	individuals	we	're	working	directly	with	companies	on	developer	policies	to	make	this	a	reality
bm	is	getting	closer	with	their	newer	lt	sizes
zoe	is	rocking	the	stage
rt	no	pressure
yes	and	yes
but	amazon	is	generally	a	terrible	place	to	buy	any	clothing	other	than	socks	gt;.&gt
the	swap	amp	sale	page	on	facebook	is	realllly	good	for	finding	older	pieces	at	normal	prices
rt	it	's	great	to	see	this	being	tackled	on	so	many	different	fronts	at	once	voltron	indeed
soon	soon	soon
it	is	fitting	that	we	are	now	seeing	these	strong	women	speaking	out	and	trying	to	fix	problems	that	others	are	uncertain	of	how	to	tackle
email	randi	at	if	you	need	my	pager	address	for	urgent	concerns	i	can	give	that	to	you
just	the	site
ty	we	got	that	out	in	a	hurry	will	fix	it
not	sure	about	a	stream	but	i	'll	have	at	the	very	least	a	vine	of	zoe	making	the	announcement	and	i	'll	be	livetweeting
i	am	so	excited	and	happy	that	i	want	to	cry	what	is	this
although	vine	may	work	too	since	it	's	like	a	small	part	of	what	you	are	talking	about	dunno
hey	can	you	poke	the	organizer	i	was	thinking	about	streaming	this	maybe	twitch
.@holman	yo	i	use	ruby	where	are	my	ladies

it	's	almost	time
i	may	be	off	the	igda	's	christmas	card	list	oops	you	'll	be	able	to	make	guesses	as	to	why	later	today
we	talk	about	gamergate	a	lot	but	the	truth	is	gamergate	is	n't	the	real	battle	it	's	a	symptom	of	a	larger	problem
oh	gosh	she	mentioned	me	and	in	her	talk	and	now	i	am	blushing	and	trying	not	to	sniffle
i	ca	n't	even	find	the	words	to	describe	how	much	i	value	the	work	of	all	the	people	i	've	met	during	this	time	how	much	i	love	all	of	them
this	is	so	weird	you	guys	so	weird	so	awesome	if	you	had	asked	me	a	year	ago	where	i	would	be	i	never	would	have	guessed	this
will	def	be	getting	back	to	this	though	i	think	salesforce	will	be	a	good	idea	for	us
today	i	am	happy	to	announce	the	online	abuse	prevention	initiative	created	with	amp
there	's	very	little	in	specifics	that	i	am	free	to	discuss	at	this	point	but	i	can	give	some	overview
ruby	's	implementation	of	threading	definitely	does	not	get	me	hot
we	know	what	online	abuse	looks	like	we	've	been	studying	it	and	we	will	create	reports	and	publish	our	findings
it	's	the	eye	makeup	that	makes	it	all	difficult
i	'm	going	to	lug	my	macbook	air	my	ipad	my	3ds	and	my	surface	pro	2	with	me	i	need	my	battle	station	this	will	suffice
i	'm	here	and	i	'm	hiding	because	i	am	literally	wearing	spoilers	for	the	announcement	:p
you	too
i	do	n't	think	i	'm	going	to	be	able	to	record	so	if	you	could	amp	post	to	twitter	that	would	be	awesome
online	harassment	is	something	most	people	have	faced	at	some	point	regardless	of	their	views	on	ethics	in	games	journalism
this	is	a	problem	that	affects	everyone	but	we	have	seen	far	more	harassment	targeting	women
you	should	try	guyliner	is	the	best	not	gon	na	even	joke	about	that
setting	up	dns	and	mail	forwards	and	twitter	accounts	and	analytics	and	trying	to	do	my	eye	makeup	at	the	same	time	why	is	life	so	hard
press	is	involved	good	luck	with	that
1	hour	21	minutes
yeah	not	good	to	go	assuming	all	abuse	happens	around	gg	that	's	just	not	the	case
you	are	n't	alone	in	this	you	're	never	alone	in	this
rt	gon	na	be	making	a	big	announcement	at	the	panel	i	am	on	about	online	harassment	today	:d

having	a	high	level	of	toxicity	in	your	community	can	lead	to	more	serious	cases	of	harassment	and	abuse	so	we	need	to	tackle	this	head	on

gaming	companies	are	rarely	tech	companies	that	's	not	their	core	competency	but	they	deal	with	inordinate	amounts	of	abuse
i	do	have	to	go	get	us	an	actual	business	address	soon	so	we	can	finish	with	the	paperwork	to	get	501c3	status	so	it	is	all	temporary

i	'm	glad	it	was	able	to	help
rather	amused	at	the	uneducated	criticism	i	'm	hearing	about	from	gamergate	they	think	a	nonprofit	means	i	wo	n't	have	to	pay	taxes
that	's	a	scary	thought	:p
soon	we	've	been	working	on	it	got	ta	move	fast
the	amount	of	kind	words	and	support	we	've	received	from	all	of	you	has	been	immense	thank	you	all	so	very	much
giving	a	ted	talk	has	been	one	of	my	goals	for	forever	i	just	had	to	find	the	thing	i	was	passionate	about	found	it
difficult	to	write	those	with	current	limitations	of	developer	policy
we	should	chat	soon
been	there
rt	and	the	sad	thing	is	to	list	all	the	names	affected	by	this	crap	would	take	days	if	not	months	time	to	fix	it

bahahaha
putting	the	tools	into	the	hands	of	users	is	a	great	idea	we	need	more	active	solutions	for	protecting	ourselves

awesome	:d

ok	yeah	no	gdc	today	coughing	too	much	to	do	next	week	ca	n't	risk	full	blown	consars
do	n't	put	on	the	cape	unless	you	're	ready	to	be	a	hero
i	see
spoilers
stop	calling	for	the	head	of	whoever	made	that	tweet	earlier	it	was	retracted	that	is	not	a	reasonable	response
most	of	tech	does	n't	really	know	about	gamergate	and	does	n't	care	in	a	bigger	sense	gamergate	has	no	importance
this	is	my	work
how	do	i	even	have	an	ear	ache	i	am	not	4
oh	my	god	is	adorable	i	have	a	crush

rt	as	an	actual	irs	employee	yeah	we	do	n't	care
i	had	that	for	a	while	in	the	beginning	but	now	i	have	code	that	keeps	track	of	all	of	it	for	me	if	it	's	needed
keep	in	mind	that	pa	put	a	sexual	predator	in	charge	of	security	and	then	brushed	it	under	the	rug	2yrs	ago
at	the	very	least	it	's	actionable	by	twitter	is	good	enough	for	law	enforcement

who	does	n't	love	hugs	hugs	are	one	of	my	favorite	things
i	've	been	mostly	ignoring	it	but	she	's	clearly	fixated	and	making	weird	accusations	has	never	once	directly	talked	to	me
i	think	i	had	him	muted	because	he	was	misconfigured	to	randomly	tweet	at	me	:p
not	cool

ok	i	have	to	say	that	i	at	least	love	how	they	are	sticking	to	the	correct	pronoun
except	that	features	like	that	should	n't	have	a	pay	barrier
storing	it	for	later
i	suppose	i	have	to	get	used	to	the	idea	of	bloggers	using	my	name	to	get	hits	but	slightly	irritated
i	am	not	surprised	in	the	slightest	i	wish	that	i	was
now	i	have	to	login	to	randi_ebooks	and	add	him	to	the	bot	base	blacklist	so	uh	thanks	for	that
i	know	you	're	going	through	a	lot	right	now	i	can	help	with	some	of	this	dm	or	email	randi	at
i	m	sorry	wat
:p	oapi	coverage	in	wsj	venturebeat	more	good	mention	here
that	's	his	original	account	renamed
i	started	putting	pocky	through	my	lip	rings	that	seems	reasonable
i	'm	glad	to	hear	that	you	are	so	supportive	of	women	and	condemn	the	constant	stream	of	harassment	they	receive
ugh	what	did	they	do	this	year
hey	that	party	at	gdc	right	after	promoting	not	cool
no	doubt	i	do	n't	really	have	the	time	for	lawsuits	so	it	's	a	question	of	resource	allocation	vs	benefit
so	it	causes	problems	with	other	bots
matcha
do	n't	do	dumbass	things	i	kicked	the	bot
do	you	realize	how	creepy	and	inappropriate	that	tweet	is
anything	i	say	publicly	gets	quoted	by	the	press
i	've	just	seen	way	to	many	abuse	preventatives	lately	that	suggest	some	sort	of	pay	wall	ca	n't	get	behind	that
i	'm	pushing	more	for	these	to	be	options	added	by	twitter	or	using	free	scripts
revenge	porn	dude	is	hilarious	if	you	listen	to	him	he	thinks	large	tech	companies	should	n't	exist
i	do	n't	tend	to	talk	about	it	much	:p	personal	info

but	on	the	other	hand	it	sends	a	message	and	i	'm	not	used	to	having	to	be	concerned	about	an	org	's	image	vs	my	own
if	you	talk	to	people	it	's	called	collusion	not	conversation	get	it	right
yo	you	're	enforcing	at	pax	this	year	right	can	you	find	a	person
.@sindarina	tweetbot	is	a	paid	client
apparently	not
my	bot
please	stop	including	me	in	that	post	i	use	it	for	reference	but	i	used	to	live	with	her	and	we
i	still	do	n't	understand	the	whole	white	knight	things	knights	get	land	armor	sword	horse	who	would	n't	want	this	land	in	sf
same	i	recently	bought	their	kingpin	card	i	always	buy	nvidia
there	's	one	particular	person	that	has	tweeted	about	me	more	than	40	times	in	the	past	12	hours	this	has	been	her	pattern	for	the	gt;1	week
we	've	got	a	pr	firm	i	might	toss	this	their	way
not	fond	of	the	idea	of	creating	features	with	a	money	barrier
i	'm	not	really	concerned	when	it	comes	to	gaters	being	gatery	about	me	but	regarding	this	org	that	's	a	problem
i	have	other	experiences	that	are	not	fine	from	the	standpoint	of	being	an	ex	volunteer
on	one	hand	the	only	voice	she	has	is	with	gaters	which	does	n't	really	affect	oapi	's	reach

that	is	a	lot	harder	developer	policy	prohibits	it
wait	which	enforcer
eh	this	is	turning	into	more	of	a	legal	concern
and	this	is	why	i	hate	that	bot	because	it	's	a	misconfigured	pos	that	does	n't	have	ebooks	in	it	's	name
eek	also	hi	i	followed	you	because	you	're	awesome	lt;3
can	you	send	it	up	i	'm	not	exactly	at	my	computer	right	now
built	in	would	be	good	i	can	do	more	with	3rd	party	services	than	i	can	by	providing	a	client	in	the	meanwhile
yeah	it	was	pretty	accurate	i	do	n't	see	why	that	dude	thought	that	these	were	bad	things
the	empty	chair	gdc	2015
needs	to	rename	the	bot	to	something_ebooks	and	this	would	n't	be	a	problem
so	much	pocky
he	thinks	the	entire	world	should	be	indies
rt	women	at	gdc	share	heartbreaking	stories	this	is	how	chooses	to	respond

this	is	awesome	and	i	love	this
ughhhh	now	to	decide	what	to	submit	gt;.&gt
she	's	trying	to	summon	a	mob	making	false	allegations	about	oapi	and	in	general	acting	worrisome	pondering	if	i	need	to	lawyer	up
oooo	almost	forgot	need	to	submit	to	cfp	for
i	'm	also	quite	curious	about	this	and	wondering	about	the	radio	silence	from
hmm	that	tweet	may	be	actionable
sickened	but	not	surprised	by	what	happened	at	pax	earlier	today	pax	has	a	history	of	making	poor	decisions	at	the	cost	of	women	's	safety
no
i	love	amp	support	sex	workers	am	friends	with	many
i	stand	by
what	i	took	out	of	this	is	that	i	am	's	sockpuppet	correct	me	if	i	am	wrong
since	i	'm	joining	the	startup	scene	it	seems	like	a	bad	thing	that	i	'm	looking	forward	to	season	2	of	silicon	valley	but	it	looks	so	good
here	's	an	idea	how	about	the	ability	to	mute	someone	for	n	period	of	time
need	a	way	to	switch	btwn	sets	of	tabs	have	a	bunch	of	tabs	open	for	a	wow	addon	i	'm	writing	that	creates	goog	calendar	for	garrison
ooo	i	like	that
yo	check	out	it	has	helped	me	so	much	with	eyestrain
well	i	bought	a	case	of	it	sooo	:p
blocked	you	i	thought	she	blocked	someone	else
i	am	right	now	watching	enforcers	defend	chums	on	facebook
turning	it	into	a	block	list	could	be	pretty	rad	too
iirc	tweetbot	is	a	paid	app	i	'm	not	necessarily	thinking	full	fledged	client
i	'm	mostly	pondering	a	few	startup	incubators	that	are	now	accepting	non	profit	applications
that	was	a	comment	taken	from	polygon	's	article	on	the	panel
so	it	would	auto	unmute	after	n	hours	or	whatever
seeing	a	lot	of	talk	about	gdc	vs	pax	i	felt	safer	at	gdc	post	gamergate	than	i	did	at	pax	pre	gamergate	so	there	's	that
are	not	exactly	on	speaking	terms

rt	all	of	us	right	now	where	have	you	been	all	our	lives
i	do	n't	think	so	it	was	just	found
yes
that	's	a	markov	bot	not	a	human
you	are	one	of	my	favorite	people	bby	follower4ever
i	'm	a	monogamous	girl	in	a	polygamous	world
dad
also	a	few	famous	people	followed	me	and	now	i	'm	freaking	out	that	i	tweet	too	much	amp	do	n't	want	to	scare	them	off	:p
ok	whenever	you	've	calmed	yourself	poke	me	on	facebook	and	i	'll	tell	you	why	it	's	a	problem	w	the	code	base
i	am	sorry	journalists	but	this	is	kind	of	a	place	for	me	to	just	vent	gt;.&gt	i	like	you	i	really	do	but	not	for	this	lt;3
but	does	it	scale
it	's	minimum	wage	this	started	happening	about	4	years	ago	i	think
selfies	are	rad	^.^
rt	i	wonder	if	has	seen	this
aw	gt;.&gt
but	given	that	these	people	seem	to	not	understand	the	difference	between	charity	and	npo	why	bother	giving	them	my	time
yo	bby	i	'm	chaotic	good
yeah	it	's	pretty	rad	for	managing	multiple	accounts	in	various	services
that	's	how	it	works	with	a	private	account
i	did	n't	read	them	:p	i	was	sent	a	few	screencaps	which	is	why	i	was	a	bit	concerned
i	guess	he	was	trying	to	say	that	who	knows	:p
i	'm	watching	enforcers	say	that	they	knew	it	was	only	a	matter	of	time	until	this	happened	still	nothing	was	done
i	heard	it	correctly	1:57:20
i	got	spells	for	that
meh	i	have	a	couple	of	pathfinder	modules	but	it	's	not	really	my	thing
guests	use	my	aria	i	get	emails	w	their	weight	sometimes	when	we	're	playing	card	games	i	'll	silently	mouth	the	number	at	them	i	win
that	was	my	intention	:p
totally	got	the	flag
you	are	married	young	miss	go	hither
tweetbot	is	a	paid	client	:p
this	one	is	more	official	ish	less	tweets	i	think	i	'm	still	figuring	out	my	role	as	ceo	amp	keeping	normal	persona
i	almost	typed	is	it	in	the	cloud	forgetting	that	i	have	keyboard	input	word	replace	for	cloud	to	butt
it	's	not	internet	rules	it	's	the	way	the	code	is	written
i	guess	i	've	been	doing	a	good	enough	job	that	a	pua	mra	site	decided	i	was	public	enemy	something	to	write	home	about
tweetdeck	has	gotten	a	lot	better	they	finally	fixed	the	big	blocklist	bugs
we	should	have	some	more	info	posted	about	oapi	soon	lots	of	questions	about	if	we	are	hiring	glad	to	see	people	so	excited
this	guy	has	on	his	serious	face
rt	bahah	google	suggestions	knows	what	's	up
hey	if	you	toss	me	more	info	about	that	i	can	pass	it	up	the	chain	to	enforcer	type	people	it	would	be	appreciated
ooo	that	's	old	school	i	did	n't	even	think	of	that
seriously	how	am	i	the	only	person	that	caught	this	this	just	confirms	my	belief	that	i	'm	the	only	person	that	watches	the	morning	news
always
the	only	thing	that	's	really	concerning	is	that	she	's	stalkerish	in	her	obsession	reminds	me	of	dude	that	showed	up	at	my	work
speaking	of	which	i	was	able	to	oom	my	t2.micro	servers	with	that	script	:p	hehe
wat
so	ready
i	ca	n't	play	this	game	drunk
time	to	learn	the	art	of	writing	to	apply	for	grants	seems	like	different	orgs	prefer	drastically	different	styles	high	level	vs	detailed
redis	is	overkill	for	what	i	'm	doing	i	want	something	more	portable	daemonless
full	blown	redis	is	overkill	for	what	i	'm	doing	will	try	this	out

wait	which	d&amp;d	version
if	you	get	a	follow	from	yes	that	is	me	being	a	ceo	is	scary	and	i	want	a	private	account	for	yelling	:p
dude	stop	snapping	at	me	what	is	your	deal
and	that	shit	freaks	me	out	not	that	she	would	likely	do	anything	but	that	she	could	rile	someone	up	enough	to	do	something
if	you	send	a	follow	request	and	i	know	you	i	'll	likely	approve	it	if	i	do	n't	know	you	meh	maybe
my	nickname	is	grandma	gt;.&gt
eh	i	knew	she	'd	take	credit	for	me	utilizing	my	old	work	account	but	i	ca	n't	really	let	gg	affect	my	life	decisons	lt;3
i	do	n't	think	i	've	ever	even	directly	mentioned	her	username	tho	but	i	'm	sure	she	'll	still	yell	dogpile
this	is	a	conversation	i	had	with	one	of	chums	friends	earlier	today
have	realized	that	8	hours	in	my	logic	goes	to	hell	and	it	's	all	rabbit	holes	and	uncommitted	code	good	reason	to	take	a	break
i	'm	starting	to	do	more	stuff	that	is	team	based	though	so	i	'm	thinking	tweetdeck	is	the	way	to	go
i	just	could	n't	ever	develop	lasting	romantic	feelings	for	anyone	that	prefered	d&amp;d	4th	edition	over	3.5
a	community	is	generally	great	at	policing	itself	but	not	once	the	well	is	already	poisoned	or	something
breaking	from	the	whitehouse	user	face	designer	is	now	a	tech	job	title
i	love	what	they	've	done	with	trolls
but	right	now	i	'm	dealing	with	friends	getting	rape	and	death	threats	so	sorry	your	anger	is	n't	really	a	big	deal	later
mayyybe	i	do	n't	like	virtual	d&amp;d	i	ca	n't	literally	set	things	on	fire	and	cause	havoc
it	's	like	d&amp;d	for	peasants
sometimes
but	regardless	i	do	n't	need	to	see	her	crud	linked	she	's	picking	targets	to	gain	supporters	old	news
5th	edition	does	n't	exist	we	don't	speak	of	that
i	have	the	fitbit	aria	scale	it	's	a	wifi	scale	logs	to	internet	which	is	awesome	but	not	for	the	reasons	you	'd	think
i	added	a	1	gb	swap	:p
right	now	multiple	browsers	:p	i	should	set	up	tweetdeck	for	this
i	think	this	is	spam	i	'm	not	sure	what	i	'm	reading	but	it	's	funny
unless	you	are	the	help	desk	person	i	am	talking	to	it	is	unlikely	i	've	been	doing	obscene	things	to	ruby	all	evening

and	now	mods	of	ghazi	are	under	fire	by	a	mob	that	appears	to	have	been	led	by	you

as	gamergate	has	repeatedly	proven	linking	a	url	does	n't	mean	shit	for	comprehension	lt;3
unfortunately	no	text	filters	are	too	high	risk
even	though	i	tweet	a	lot	:p	hehe

wikipedia	says	that	there	were	no	sanctions	against	food	and	medicine	try	again	microbrain

the	problem	is	in	your	lie	that	the	deaths	were	caused	by	us	sanctions	purchase	of	food	by	iraq	was	never	sanctioned
the	russian	tanks	are	in	crimea	and	e.	ukraine	show	me	the	american	tanks	microbrain
where	is	your	evidence	that	any	of	these	people	are	nazis	putin	troll
here	is	an	isis	medical	student	at	work
again	you	jump	to	unsupported	conclusions	just	like	your	absurd	coup	idea
to	divide
lol	a	staged	escorted	video	shot	at	gun	point	how	stupid	can	you	get
certainly	the	paper	shows	that	the	idea	that	drinking	water	was	the	only	or	main	health	issue	in	iraq	is	a	lie
the	saudis	pay	for	a	lot	of	them

so	where	is	your	evidence	of	the	intentional	destruction	of	water	give	me	a	link	to	facts	not	opinions

nazi	ideological	indoctrination	and	wiki	will	tell	you	that	half	the	world	's	neo	nazis	live	in	russia
nope	reported	by	multiple	sources
you	are	the	one	with	the	conspiracy	theories	the	turkish	army	collaboration	has	been	proven	multiple	times

if	that	is	your	count	then	the	amount	of	muslims	in	the	world	is	one	tenth	of	what	is	claimed
it	's	a	staged	escorted	report	done	at	gunpoint	are	you	dumb	enough	to	give	that	credibility
same	applies	to	14th	waffen	ss	they	fought	for	nazis	to	get	rid	of	soviets	they	never	had
seems	like	everything	get	's	stuck	at	50	sinjar	and	kobane

the	first	one	seems	to	come	from	the	far	left	wing	rag	the	progressive	the	article	is	by	thomas	nagy


i	guess	while	your	trying	to	shove	your	sanctimoniousness	at	people	you	ca	n't	read	your	forehead
sanctions	did	n't	kill	anyone	birdbrain	there	were	no	sanctions	against	iraq	buying	food	you	people	are	as	deluded	as	ever
it	's	islam	aftermath	microbrain	it	's	always	been	that	way
pilgars	repetition	of	the	russian	propaganda	line	about	ukrainian	nazis	is	an	insufferable	lie

first	bandera	fought	for	nazis	but	he	was	also	in	a	nazi	prison

the	idea	that	the	us	is	trying	to	provoke	russia	in	light	of	russian	invasion	of	crimea	and	e.	ukr	is	absurd
repeating	as	everyone	knows	is	your	way	of	saying	that	you	just	sit	around	and	repeat	the	bs	of	your	left	wing	clones
it	goes	on	the	assumption	that	the	admiration	of	stephan	bandera	means	support	for	a	nazi	ideology	false

printing	some	bs	from	an	unsourced	us	hating	conspiracy	nut	like	yourself	does	not	constitute	evidence	of	anything


that	was	because	isis	were	watching	the	new	cantlie	propaganda	film	in	the	cultural	center	when	they	hit	it	microbrain
borrowed	from	q	on	startrek
some	day	i	will	go	out	of	my	way	to	piss	on	his	grave
here	is	the	paper	in	reading	it	i	find	nothing	to	support	the	allegations

pilgar	is	a	lying	low	life	piece	of	dog	shit	and	there	is	no	other	way	to	put	it

of	the	three	papers	that	he	references	i	have	so	far	only	been	able	to	locate	the	third

there	were	no	us	commandos
okay	microbrain	show	me	proof	that	the	sanctions	included	food	or	medicine	and	stop	babbling	about	experts
no	like	the	idiot	leftist	that	you	are	you	believe	that	endless	repetition	constitutes	truth
we	are	not	arguing	deaths	we	are	arguing	the	cause	sadam	was	the	cause	not	sanctions
it	is	the	same	mindset	of	all	islamic	terrorist	groups	and	there	are	over	100	of	them
i	'm	going	to	continue	looking	for	the	other	papers	to	see	if	they	help	his	case	or	show	it	to	be	politically	motivated

they	learn	it	from	the	quran	and	hadiths	like	these
rt	barbarism	today	what	's	left	of	nabi	shiyt	shrine	in	after	state	terrorists	demolish	it

why	were	innocent	civilians	in	prison

you	blabber	on	endlessly	without	presenting	a	single	fact	show	where	we	sanctioned	food	and	medicine	or	shut	up


not	only	were	there	no	sanctions	against	food	and	medicine	but	sadam	was	allowed	to	sell	oil	in	exchange	for	food	amp	medicine

is	it	possible	to	ask	a	more	stupid	question
the	writer	is	a	nut	case	in	suggesting	a	power	sharing	arrangement	with	isis	and	nusra	basically	he	just	rants	and	complains

bandera	's	joining	with	nazis	was	to	rid	ukraine	of	soviets	and	had	no	relationship	to	him	supporting	ideology
there	was	no	us	coup	in	ukraine	microbrain

and	you	pick	the	same	old	lying	scab	until	you	finally	die
anyone	who	believes	that	you	can	have	compromise	or	power	sharing	with	people	of	an	absolutist	islamic	mindset	is	delusional

lies	and	propaganda	this	is	raqqa
now	the	daesh	must	either	reinforce	kobane	or	loose	it	so	the	coalition	must	protect	the	roads	into	kobane	against	reinforcement
how	can	you	not	side	with	kurdish	fighters	that	always	smile	and	that	regularly	circle	up	hold	hands	sing	and	dance

rt	turkey	keeps	giving	weapons	to	the	terrorists	in	syria
and	yezidis	are	fighting	side	by	side	with	kurds	not	with	any	sunni	arabs
your	demand	for	perfection	would	lead	to	those	kids	living	under	isis	and	brought	up	as	terrorists
the	government	is	not	the	us	americans	hate	the	saudi	monarchy
salahuddin	was	a	kurd	and	decent	general	just	fighting	for	a	bad	cause
to	isis	the	japanese	are	just	kafirs	like	everyone	else	that	is	not	a	sunni	muslim
as	soon	as	isis	chased	all	the	minorities	out	of	mosul	the	sunni	arabs	were	happy	to	steal	their	property	so	fuck	them
there	are	a	few	kurds	who	betrayed	their	people	and	joined	the	daesh	criminals	and	a	few	stayed	and	live	in	fear
are	you	hoping	for	a	lot	of	dead	civilians	to	serve	your	propaganda	goals
jews	do	well	because	most	are	secular	and	because	they	place	a	high	value	on	education	instead	of	jihad
you'r	liar	you	lived	with	them	as	dhimmis	third	class	citizens	with	no	legal	right	and	they	were	all	exterminated	in	saudi
rt	sources	in	mosul	while	isis	terrorists	were	preparing	a	tanker	of	chlorine	gas	to	attack	peshmerga	its	destroyed	by	rocket

or	they	bought	it	from	hobby	lobby	and	ca	n't	figure	out	how	it	goes	together	lol
help	from	raqqa	to	mosul	will	have	to	go	the	long	way	around	and	wo	n't	be	able	to	reinforce	kobane
so	do	you	think	that	the	daesh	are	planning	the	second	battle	of	the	trench	to	be	in	mosul	instead	of	medina
there	are	literally	millions	of	inventions	your	list	is	like	nothing	and	all	of	it	would	have	been	invented	by	someone	else

so	what	is	your	solution	buckey	just	let	isis	take	over	the	world	or	do	you	just	like	being	sanctimonious
with	that	kind	of	lack	of	reality	contact	i	can	now	see	why	you	joined	isis
they	need	to	try	to	reconnect	raqqa	sinjar	tal	afar	and	mosul	but	they	will	fail	because	of	not	enough	men

there	was	no	random	bombardment	with	chemical	weapons	the	isis	chemical	weapons	were	blown	up

rt	more	on	the	gas	cloud	over	that	caused	locals	to	panic	mosul	eye	blogger	says	it	was	bomb	gone	wrong

the	cowards	are	the	ones	hiding	behind	the	civilians	in	mosul	instead	of	going	to	meet	the	pesh	that	are	right	there

do	you	think	of	democracy	in	the	hamas	sense	one	man	one	vote	one	time

you	mean	popular	among	dictators
for	the	ukrainians	who	bamdera	is	a	hero	he	only	holds	that	status	for	fighting	the	soviets	in	ukr

most	of	the	trouble	was	from	political	corruption	which	is	what	the	ukrainians	were	protesting
but	regardless	isis	will	be	completely	defeated	i	guarantee	it	they	are	too	technologically	backward	to	win	a	modern	war

because	what	you	think	is	islam	has	no	resemblance	to	the	real	islam
yes	i	have	this	is	the	truth	about	islam
islam	did	n't	free	the	slaves	microbrain	did	your	imam	tell	you	that	lie	also
okay	you	had	your	chance	at	an	honest	discussion	now	you	are	blocked

they	are	in	about	20	verses	of	the	quran	and	they	are	in	the	hadiths
i	got	them	directly	off	that	muslim	students	website
are	you	so	stupid	that	you	do	n't	understand	that	what	you	are	presenting	is	lies	used	to	convert	you
do	we	agree	that	islam	tells	women	to	stay	at	home	and	not	display
no	they	had	no	rights	in	a	court	of	law	and	had	to	hide	the	practice	of	their	religion	from	muslims	and	had	to	pay	jizya

look	at	you	you	ca	n't	even	defend	a	single	verse	of	the	quran	that	we	can	all	verify
so	now	that	we	know	that	islam	tells	women	to	stay	at	home	we	can	move	on	to	the	subject	of	forcing	women	to	obey

you	have	presented	a	pile	of	lying	crap	that	does	not	come	from	the	quran	or	hadiths

more	muslim	women	treated	like	queens
every	time	some	deluded	idiot	converts	to	islam	the	muslims	make	propaganda	out	of	it
i	do	n't	see	your	33:33	only	something	about	a	house	and	ca	n't	breath	what	does	that	have	to	do	with	33:33
when	the	taliban	make	women	wear	burquas	are	they	not	preventing	women	from	displaying	themselves
this	is	your	tweet	it	is	not	33:33
i	'm	trying	to	get	us	a	starting	point	give	me	33:33	from	your	own	quran
but	you	are	so	stupid	that	you	do	n't	even	know	where	to	find	hadiths
are	you	so	stupid	that	you	do	n't	know	how	to	find	your	own	hadiths	and	quran	verses
can	we	all	agree	that	33:33	tells	women	to	stay	at	home
we	will
why	does	n't	she	know	that	her	prophet	said	that	most	dwellers	of	hell	were	women
yeah	cheney	was	in	the	burqua	selling	business
again	showing	you	know	nothing	about	islam
some	lying	imams	put	together	a	package	of	taqiyya	and	wrapped	it	in	a	pretty	pink	bow	to	sucker	you
what	does	your	quran	33:33	say
you	did	n't	learn	anything	about	the	religion	some	imam	fed	you	a	raft	of	lies	to	get	you	to	convert
no	muslim	women	created	a	university
i	've	been	debating	islam	with	muslims	for	years	most	know	little	about	their	religion	microbrain
your	knowledge	of	islam	is	worse	than	zero	because	it	's	all	imam	fed	lies
stop	making	up	lies	show	me	with	a	verse
your	imams	write	crap	on	a	piece	of	paper	and	you	think	it	comes	from	hadith	or	the	quran
it	's	blazingly	obvious	that	all	you	kids	have	been	hand	fed	your	opinions	about	islam	by	some	imam
again	you	are	a	lying	piece	of	shit	and	i	will	prove	it
you	are	the	lying	piece	of	shit	i	gave	you	evidence	for	everything	i	said	from	quran	you	gave	nothing	but	lies
show	me	the	hadith	where	you	get	your	information	i	'm	waiting
and	what	does	your	quran	33:33	say	come	on	anybody
do	the	taliban	lock	women	up	at	home	like	33:33	tells	them
rt	.@robbiesingh2	only	has	rules	for	not	mentioning	and	protecting	islam	islamists	amp	jihadist	they	love	to	abuse	ho
you	are	beyond	stupid	you	believe	your	imam	and	research	nothing
and	100	of	jews	and	christians	were	exterminated	in	saudi	and	other	places
again	you	present	your	imam	's	propaganda	you	have	no	hadiths	or	verses
here	is	the	truth	about	slavery
or	i	can	go	to	the	proven	barbaric	attitudes	of	muslims	as	an	excellent	reason	to	hate	islam
sure	that	's	a	good	excuse
why
the	israelis	should	demand	back	the	40	of	the	arabian	peninsula	that	the	muslims	stole	from	them
i	cut	out	4:34	in	arabic	and	stuck	it	into	google	translate
you	can	deny	it	until	i	prove	it
there	is	absolutely	no	reason	for	israel	to	give	up	an	inch	of	land	since	that	will	get	them	nothing	from	muslims
i	got	help	five	professional	translators	that	all	say	strike
even	pickthall	who	is	an	englishman	was	a	muslim	convert
good	night
and	because	of	4:34	beating	would	not	be	a	reason	in	a	sharia	court
i	would	have	to	do	a	search	so	let	's	forget	that	one	for	now
what	does	your	2:282	say
would	it	be	irony	if	the	name	was	vile_naziism	in	the	same	way	it	's	not	irony	when	it	's	vile_islam
rofl	now	there	is	a	load	of	putin	manufactured	bullshit	if	i	ever	saw	one
apparently	the	iranian	fascist	ayatollahs	run	it
no	not	going	to	bed	with	her	is	a	seperate	option	there	is	no	mentally
what	does	your	4:34	say	same	as	these
we	can	get	that	much	from	the	quran	so	maybe	the	hadiths	can	help	us	clarify

who	's	translation	are	you	using
okay	so	let	's	try	one	more	verse	what	does	your	2:282	say
i	read	the	whole	it	does	n't	change	33:33	at	all
no	it	clearly	says	to	beat	them	the	rest	are	other	options	beat	them	is	there	in	black	and	white	not	what	you	say
rt	minister	of	today	's	victories	in	achieved	by	the	support	of	coalition	airpower	and	iraqi	army	ha
so	these	are	hadiths	that	i	copied	from	the	usc	muslim	students	hadith	database	look	them	up	for	yourself
in	that	hadith	it	says	the	reason	is	that	women	lack	intelligence
beating	her	was	not	recommended	but	allowed
rt	why	deny	facts	straight	from	the	palestinian	horse	's	mouth	https
old	enough	not	to	be	fooled	by	religious	frauds
yeap	breeding	and	violence	are	the	only	thing	they	do	well
and	by	the	way	i	'm	not	jewish	or	israeli	if	i	were	i	would	announce	it	proudly
why	do	you	think	all	the	translators	use	strike
no	he	was	killed	because	of	negative	comments	about	putin
yes	i	hate	the	religion	of	hate
he	was	killed	because	putin	wanted	him	dead	the	rest	is	a	blatantly	obvious	putin	coverup
but	the	five	professional	translators	many	of	them	muslims	do	know	arabic	for	some	it	is	their	first	language
rt	islam	or	else	really	that	's	what	they	are	taught	to	pray	those	who	earned	anger	amp	those	that	have	went	astray
what	do	you	think	you	are	spreading	muslim	bigot
and	here	we	have	it	what	does	your	4:34	say
just	block	me	and	stop	crying
and	hating	islam	is	rational	and	therefore	not	a	phobia
but	the	quran	says	that	verses	can	be	abrogated	right	now	let	's	get	to	compulsion	later	what	does	4:34	say
i	know	that	if	your	husband	divorces	you	he	get	's	control	of	kids
i	doubt	that	a	single	person	on	the	supreme	court	knew	what	sunnah	or	hadith	meant

and	the	prophet	ruined	their	faith	by	raping	them
only	two	verses	and	we	are	making	progress
no	they	are	not	muslims
google	translate	used	the	word	beat	i	hope	that	settles	it
sorry	i	block	cretins
there	is	not	and	never	has	been	a	country	called	palestine	microbrain	and	that	land	has	been	the	home	of	jews	for	3000	years
but	let	's	go	on	to	the	hadith	that	refers	back	to	2.282
you	are	a	liar	the	palestinians	never	had	a	country	and	the	jews	were	settled	not	bedouins
muslims	need	to	get	off	the	land	they	stole	from	the	jews	now
i	know	saudis	chased	girls	into	a	burning	building
beyond	the	five	translators	here	is	google	translate
hey	it	's	what	your	prophet	mohammed	actually	did	not	just	talk	about	so	what	is	your	problem
muslims	celebrating	international	women	's	day
stay	on	33:33	until	we	agree	what	it	says
that	explains	his	dedication	to	islam
thanks	for	parading	your	racism
i	've	got	4	translations	that	say	hit	and	one	that	says	scourge
you	might	like	to	watch	this	have	a	nice	day
i	'll	give	it	to	you	again
you	are	babbling	33:33	says	this
it	does	n't	require	muscles	to	be	a	witness	so	can	we	assume	the	lack	is	mental	or	emotional
female	slavery	in	saudi
the	translators	knew	arabic	so	they	are	right
interesting	that	kurds	are	fighting	for	their	own	land	but	the	islamist	who	support	palestine	oppose	the	kurds
here	is	a	screen	shot	of	what	i	got
is	it	one	of	these	children
no	they	do	n't	40	of	the	arabian	peninsula	belonged	jews	before	the	muslims	began	exterminating	them	give	it	back
showing	that	you	are	a	liar	since	there	is	zero	evidence
4:34	is	in	the	quran	not	the	hadith	and	you	do	n't	explain	why	5	translators	would	use	strike
yeah	it	's	a	generous	sentiment	but	it	's	not	true
another	muslim	blowhard	the	average	gdp	in	saudi	is	less	than	the	us	and	women	r	slaves
what	along	side
so	your	claim	is	that	me	are	physically	superior	right
rt	9	minutes	of	excruciating	9/11	conspiracy	theories	by	preacher	who	recently	was	handed	islam	award	by	king	http

not	unless	you	can	get	5	professional	translators	to	agree
rt	robert	spencer	in	pj	media	muslim	holidays	in	new	york	public	schools	why	not
so	i	decided	to	give	you	one	more	chance	even	beyond	the	5	translators
and	i	do	n't	walk	in	circles	around	a	black	meteor	in	mecca	under	the	delusion	that	it	will	please	god
screaming	in	pure	religious	hatred	allahu	akbar	allahu	akbar	allahu	akbar
not	talking	about	what	you	choose	to	do	i	'm	talking	about	what	islam	says
in	fact	it	was	the	jews	that	settled	medina	before	the	arabs	then	the	muslims	exterminated	them
actually	he	hit	aisha	but	i	do	n't	have	time	for	that	now

i	do	n't	have	to	live	there	to	know	you	ca	n't	drive
or	i	can	go	directly	to	the	quran	and	hadith	for	great	reasons	to	hate	islam
i	find	that	it	's	the	people	who	claim	others	do	n't	know	anything	about	islam	that	do	n't	know	anything

i	know	you	ca	n't	leave	country	without	male	permission

as	opposed	to	the	genocidal	islamist	mega	donors	that	support	blumenthal

by	the	way	i	have	to	ask	do	you	really	consider	islam	to	be	spiritual	really
rt	but	the	battle	for	poses	a	lot	of	questions	about	's	role
did	you	corner	them	in	a	toilet	and	threaten	to	talk	them	to	death
the	french	got	it	exactly	right	you	support	the	people	that	have	conduced	a	genocide	against	jews	for	1400	years
no	idiot	they	were	completely	exterminated	on	the	majority	of	the	arabian	pennisula

one	of	the	places	the	jews	settled	1500	years	ago	was	medina	they	were	original	settlers	mohammed	came	and	exterminated	them
remember	that	yanukovich	stole	30	billion	and	his	buddies	stole	another	70	billion	so	moving	up	is	easy
so	muslim	anti	christianity	is	fine	by	you	but	jewish	anti	christianity	should	be	an	offense
the	islamic	covering	is	forced	by	islam	as	part	of	sexist	persecution

are	you	complaining	do	you	know	how	to	defeat	isis	with	no	civilian	or	property	damage
eh	yeah	they	do	n't	have	any	place	to	go	but	the	tiny	red	strip
if	you	wo	n't	accept	any	evidence	then	why	bother	asking	me	for	it
and	you	know	it	's	not	true	because	you	do	n't	like	it	you	are	calling	the	muslima	in	the	video	a	liar	bye
